"Long hours varying schedule no AC,Understaffing issues negatively affects all parts of their business. However, Walmart has increased their minimum hourly rate with hopes to attract more committed employees, and retain better employees.,Generally the whole business strucutre in terms of managemnt/leadership.
Sometimes impolite customers but Online Pickup and Delivery (OPD) customers are generally better than the sales floor customers.

Dispensing can and will get tiring, sometimes it feels like people be ordering the whole store. 9/10 times a customer's item in an order will be substituted. Our job is 100% reliant on technology, if there are system shut downs it's gonna be a long day.

Team leads are constantly nagging you to stay busy. Sometimes making you do busywork. 

getting pulled to do stocking or do front-end returns.

Working at Walmart in general has a high turnover. I don't recommend working for Walmart for a long time. No one ever stays long enough to get good at what they do.,Work is life... don't have a family or personal issues as a manager. LOA's frowned on and while obviously never said out loud puts a target on you, and constant pressure to be always available. 
With ""app driven"" leadership seeing less and less family and personnel time. As you are always connected and can never disconnect. 24 hours/364 (you get Christmas off unless your overnight),Network infrastructure both within the store and on the network overall could use some upgrades. WIFI signal near the outer walls could use boosting, as well as network processing times when querying seemed to lack even during off-peak times.,If you don’t play into the politics or the system of the store, you’re gonna get screwed. There is a lot of favoritism and lots of people don’f like playing by the book. Depending on the area (specifically service areas like OGP or Automotive), you will get crumby hours to fit the needs of the department and if you close, you’re likely going to be one of the few closers who do it well or enjoy doing it. Long-term, I would not stick here unless you’re in a higher-up position or competitive.,There were at times when people would call out of work or we would be short staffed and orders were continuing to come in. It was fast paced so you had to always be doing something.,Safety at some locations is a low priority, especially at retail side.
Manager expectations can be extreme and unclear. They only have a broad task time that doesn't acount for how fast you actually work. With por management this can be a problem for new hires. I had a write up for production in my first month of working here with out a clear explanation. 
I had no problem with production at my dc job and was able to average 50 to 70% above the 100% expectation. Wich is much harder to do than stock shelves.
If you work at Walmart it can be a gamble of whether management will be fair with you.,1. There are times when a mod takes longer than expected and you’re sometimes required to stay and finish after you’re scheduled shift end.
2. Time is of essence and you’re always under time constraints so you can put yourself under constant pressure.
3. Some mods can be outright disgusting when you start taking them apart (be prepared for old chicken wing bones).,LOTS of layoffs. I had my roles eliminated 3 times in 7 years. 
Employee experience varies widely. Some teams are great, some are bad. Onboarding as an external candidate is really hard, especially because it's so big. 
Getting promoted within the company can be really challenging. I had a terrible time in every role , even when I was really successful in role. 
Plays favorites. A select few are very successful and the rest of overworked and undervalued. 
They also blatantly try to keep your wages as low as possible. 
I never felt valued for my contributions or work. 
Treats their employees like cogs in a machine. 
Performance evaluations are biased, unhelpful, and frustrating. 
Culture is so operations and action focused that strategy can go out the window. Lots of people spend most of their capacity on short term, high stress, crisis problem solving. 
So fast paced and understaffed that every job is designed to be 1.5-2 jobs. Achieving anything and being recognized for your contributions is really hard.
Workaholic culture. It's better then it used to be but still high stress.","Oct 16, 2021 - Order Filler,Jun 2, 2015 - Assistant Store Manager,Oct 5, 2021 - Online Personal Shopper,Oct 15, 2021 - Store Manager,Sep 21, 2021 - Department Manager,Oct 10, 2021 - Anonymous Employee,Oct 16, 2021 - Online Grocery Pickup Associate,Oct 3, 2021 - Over Night Stocker/Night Crew,Oct 9, 2021 - Modular Team Associate,Sep 22, 2021 - Project Manager","Current Employee,Former Employee, less than 1 year,Current Employee, less than 1 year,Former Employee,Former Employee, more than 1 year,Former Employee, more than 3 years,Former Employee, less than 1 year,Current Employee,Former Employee, more than 5 years,Former Employee","Will loose weight very quickly,Advancement opportunities, great at developing skills, great place to learn a skill and grow your resume, or grow with the company.,$14 an hour starting pay.
Depending on what role they have you some are easier than others. 
- Dispensing: Bring the order out to the customer.
- Staging: You help organize the location of customers' orders for the dispensers.
- Picking: You go out throughout the store and pick the customer's orders. 

Our store is not always running at full capacity and we have to shut down because we simply do not have enough people. 

There really aren't that many pros other than $14 an hr.,promotional opportunities are plentiful 
Several good benefits including 401k, stock share, etc. 
Compensation for management fair,Associates are one big family, who were always willing to assist when needed.,If you make friends easily and are fine with being cross-trained, it’s a great place to work. Their 401k plans and disability insurance are great. The people make the company what it is and you will meet some amazing people here. For short-term or college students, this is a great place to work. I’ve met some of my best friends here and the environment is so much fun when your coworkers are your friends.,The pay was good for a summer job. The coworkers were good people to be around and work with. I worked morning shifts from 6am to 3pm.,Benefits and pay can be very great all around. The distribution center I transferred from was a great facility. The % quotas can seem extreme at first, but as you work for the dc longer they seem more fair. Especially as a order filler.,1. Although you’re part of a team, you do have plenty of individual assignments if you like to work independently. 
2. Role allows you to set the  foundation of the whole store - you get to set new product categories and updates and learn about [potentially] exciting changes before most people. 
3. The whole store is your domain so be prepared to move from automotive oil one night to frozen dinners the next.,People are typically nice and polite. I've met some amazing people. I loved the culture of servant leadership from the top. 
Can get exposed to a lot of different subjects/industries.
Some areas have great teams and work cultures.
Doug, the CEO, seems really great and can help employees feel bought into the mission.
