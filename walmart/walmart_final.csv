- An hour lunch and 2 15 minute paid breaks","- The coaches do not communicate with each other.

- Terrible structure

- The point system itself.

- When you are hired you are supposed to learn everything in about a week or two, which makes sense but you will not be taught everything and will be written up when they forget to teach you something that you don't know yet and be called slow regardless.

- You are not paid for what you do and will be taken advantage of. There is a team called Cap 2 and the HBA team, in Cap 2 you are only supposed to zone the isles, do top stock, picks, and trucking, returns, and the occasional pallet. In HBA you are mainly to do price changes, clearance reviews, counts, outs, top stock, returns, the occasional pallet, and zoning. The overnighters are to mainly do the pallets. I constantly saw Cap 2 work in ALL of the areas of Walmart working off pallets and doing trucking alongside HBA and even doing what they call ""freight swarms"".

- You rarely get the equipment needed for your job to actually do your job and make it quicker unless you hide some of your own.

310,3.0,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",Mixed Experiences,"There are three pros of working at Walmart. First, Walmart fully pays for my college education. Second, Walmart offers a good 401k plan because Walmart offers a 100% match of up to 6% of your paycheck that is invested in your 401k. Third, walmart offers a 15% match on any Walmart stock purchases.","There are several cons about working at Walmart. First, Walmart does not pay as well as many other major retailers such as Target and Costco, which both pay a minimum of $15 an hour. Second, Walmart takes away your previously earned raises when they bump the base pay up. This year I received my second pay raise, which bumped me from $13.16 to 13.42; however, my pay second pay raise was taken away when the Walmart raised its base pay from $12.90 an hour to $14. I now only make $14.16 an hour, instead of the $14.42 an hour that I should be making, which is unbelievable to me because currently my pay is only $0.16 more than any associate that is now hired in my department. It's unbelievable to me that I have been at Walmart for almost three years and I only make 16 cents more an hour than brand new associates. Third, most Walmart managers were previously Walmart associates and the vast majority do not have any prior training in management. This leads to many Walmart managers either trying to micromanage employees, not behaving professionally, or not knowing how to properly communicate with associates.",2021-11-09, Walmart Online Grocery Pickup

Company treats foreign workers better than citizens. You will be placed 2 levels below someone that is less competent so theres no reason to stay here and expect to move up the ladder like them.

Company will force you to train offshore resources that make your life a living hell. They get treated better too because of their low cost, while you get treated bad because the offshore resources arent delivering on time and with quality.

There are too many complacent managers/ directors/ vps that are disconnected from the workforce and they will make the worse decisions youve ever seen. 

Company doesnt care about their employees mental health. They will keep you away from family to live in the middle of nowhere. 

Incompetent people that want you to do their work even though they have a higher job title than you.

A ton of project managers/ program managers (ive had 4 of them on one project and they are always asking noob questions and taking up valuable time) that arent adding any value. Their only purpose is to communicate to upper management about your work and your progress.

I am a closeted member of the LGBT community, when it comes to my job I prefer not to share that detail of my life with my coworkers because of past issues I’ve had in prior work environments. I went out on medical leave due to a chronic condition and came back to my entire department debating over my gender identity/sexual orientation. When the harassment of myself as well as multiple other people in our department/store as a whole was reported to upper management, we were told there wasn’t enough “proof” of what had been said to all of us DIRECTLY, to follow through with serious disciplinary action, therefore we were ignored and every day I get to attend work right next to my main harasser who is fully aware of who reported him now. Not to mention if you are physically fit and have a good work ethic you will be used and abused and dismissed the moment you have an issue with how you’re being treated. Employees having worked in said department for over 9 years haven’t been trained on things I was taught to do within my first week of training, or they straight up refuse to take on the tasks that are clearly part of our job description, and guess what, management happily turns a blind eye to this fact so long as the work is getting done by the two people who will actually do it.",2021-10-25, Walmart Deli Associate

1919,3.0,"Current Employee, more than 5 years",Experience may vary from Store to Store,"* Accessible. Will usually accept most types of people for as long as they meet the standard requirements for employment.
* Wage Growth. This may vary from store to store, region by region, but in just the past 5 years wages have grown from federal minimum to almost $15/hr in some regions.
* Diverse Team. This varies from store to store, but often times you will find yourself among wholesome and diverse coworkers who may not care much about the company, but will care a lot about you (management is hit or miss here).
* Benefits. If you're full-time, expect benefits after your probationary period (between 30 and 90 days). If you're part-time, you might as well go for open enrollment because it takes 12 months to get benefits.
* Transferrable. After 90 days, you may choose to change departments, store locations, or even shift into an entire different division (store, club, distribution, home office, etc).","* Policy over People. It will always hang over the heads of hourly associates. Some exceptions can be made, but if you're late too often it's an automatic termination even if management doesn't want to actually terminate the associate.
* Demanding Job ""Positions"". Crosstraining and flexible skillsets are common and associates will find themselves working jobs they're not hired to do.
* Abusive Customers. Most people view Walmart very poorly and will extend that perception onto associates in a manner where it's outright abuse. Once an associate takes off their vest and leaves the store the same customers can be delightful and kind.
* Flies. Yes, literal flies. This one may sound like a joke, but it's a truth that might not be exclusive to Walmart. I have personally worked in two different stores and flies in the break room is almost always excessive and out of control. The primary issue? Open top trash cans. It's been almost 10 years and it's still seems to be standard to just keep open top trash cans. The countermeasure is usually store-use fly paper off the shelf and one of those blue light ECOLABs (which honestly never seems to do that good of a job).",2021-09-21, Frontend Checkout TA

There are very basic opportunities for healthcare, dental, vision, life insurance etcetera if you need them.
After awhile you may get the opportunity for a set schedule.
You do get an employee discount of 10% for General merchandise and very few select groceries.
The pay starts at $11 an hour.","I'm not sure if this is just my store, but I have several cons.
The management treat you like disposable machines. The moment you're no longer useful to them or try to think for yourself, they will toss you out and replace you with some other person who will abide to their ever last waking whim. I've heard from several managers who I'm friends with who have straight told me they're instructed to treat associates poorly and not make connections with them. How do you make bonds and a healthy motivated team with people you are told not to connect with?
I mentioned benefits as a pro, but honestly if you're working for Walmart chances are you qualify for government assistance and any assistance you can get from the government will be miles better then anything Walmart has to offer. If you do want to give Walmarts benefits a try you have to jump through miles of hurdles and headaches to possibly find out you don't even qualify for their benefits. They say you qualify for benefits after a certain time, but I've been full time for a year and have worked for the company for 4 years all together and according to my HR rep I still don't qualify. Did I mention I'm diabetic? Well no mater Walmart doesn't care. If I cant afford medication they'll work me till I can't work anymore.
The discount you receive after 3 months isn't awful, but you don't even save on groceries for the most part the one thing you may really use a discount for the most. Can't feed your children oh well have 10% off this new TV.
The pay starts at $11 an hour which isn't bad or is it? Now that I think about it the Starbucks down the road pays their employees $15 an hour, Best buy makes $14, Target makes $15, McDonald's makes $13 depending on location. You know actually that $11 for all the freight, short staff, management treating you like trash, poor benefits and a discount that is actually a joke doesn't sound so appealing.

Having a set schedule is a really good benefit, but they do make changes and unless you have the schedule app on your phone, you won't get the notification of the schedule change.","Management! They are not willing to help you, but expect you to drop what you are doing to do one of their side chores. They do not communicate with everyone in the department, certain associates were favored while others were dismissed and not kept informed of changes taking place. Very little positive feed back, always what you are doing wrong with no explanation of why or what is being done wrong. Also, certain associates were not corrected when they were doing something wrong and it was pointed out physically or with pictures. Always will have to clean up and pick up the slack for the lazy associates and those that felt they didn't have to do their job completely, as other associates were made to finish their job. 

Always understaffed, in which makes those that come to work more stressed out and are expected to get the jobs of 4 people done... still no help from management! 

People lead needs replaced, incompetent and has been for years.

Having ""mandatory"" 6 days a week during back to school time (without asking the associate if they want to work the 6th day), they just schedule you.

Store manager is an issue in this store as well, never has anything positive to say to team leads. Takes the chain of command way to serious... won't speak to associates, will wait until he sees or will send a message to the team lead to relay the message about the associate, instead of asking or telling them what the issue is... has no team building moral skills at all.

Favoritism is rabid in this store as well.

Walmart does have a rich history of culture. It has seemed that they are losing the culture over the last few years, most likely due to all the acquisitions and management turnover.

The new management structure means no person is held responsible but the lowest ones on the totem pole (i.e. stockers). You will get blamed for things out of your control. If you attempt to fix any of the glaringly obvious problems you will be told you are the most insignificant person in the store and your only job is to open boxes to put on the shelf. 
The pay is decent for the area, but it honestly doesn't outweigh the stress of having to meet times for putting freight out. It also doesn't outweigh the strain put on your body from bending, lifting, and walking on hard concrete floors every night. 
Also, the stores get very hot at night during the summer/cold during the winter so be prepared to sweat profusely or freeze. 

Benefits are alright, but not the greatest. For a family of 3, look to pay approximately $200 per check for the cheapest insurance plan offered. The 10% discount you receive as an employee doesn't count towards most grocery items except during Christmas. You accrue sick and vacation days at a ridiculously slow rate. Which if you do use your sick days following the proper channels and policys, expect to be taken into the office and threatened with a disciplinary write up for failing to provide proper customer service since they are unable to do it for the actual reason.

I started working there in 2001.,"They have medical benefits, dental benefits, stock options, a certain amount of money each year to go towards optical and the 401K the best thing about the 401K is they match you a dollar for dollar. The department I worked in was the food department I wasn't just a good worker I was a great worker. So because of that the store manager gave me free reign for my department. The best thing about that was dealing with all of the vendors. I learned a lot dealing with all the different vendors from Coca-Cola to Nabisco and everything in between. All the decisions started with me and stopped with me. I was able to learn a lot doing it that way. If s potato chips wanted to do a super bowl display the vendor would come to me tell me what he wanted to do how big of a display he wanted to make and then it was my decision on where to put it where it would get the most foot traffic and the most eyeballs seeing the display and to make sure the spot I decided to put it in would maximize their sales. With the store manager allowing me to do that I was able to learn so much. I had to talk with all the vendors I learned how to wheel and deal with them. It also taught me how important displaying a product in the correct place really is for that products sales. One other thing they do about 95% of their promoting within the company. When I worked there I just happened to get very lucky and had a fantastic store manager.","I don't even know where to start or what to say.

*They promote within which is really great.","*Management as always, but it isn’t necessarily their fault we’re short staffed in my department. This job is very physically demanding, you are moving around the whole store for all eight hours of your shift. A lot of people can’t handle it.
*Only get one weekend day off. That’s to be expected with this job however, weekends are the busiest days and you’re needed the most.
*At the time of this review I’m still in my first week, my feet & legs are SO SORE. However, I’m going from doing nothing but sitting at home for 3 months (thanks COVID), to working 40 hours a week constantly running around.
*I don’t like that they let everyone know “it’s easy to get promoted”. It isn’t easy, you have to work hard and show up, but more importantly they do play a lot of favorites there. If you’re close with the managers and do well, you will get promoted. But you have to know the right people.
*Some managers I don’t listen to you. And I get it, they’re very busy and constantly working, doing jobs that associates like myself can’t do.

Hours worked was pretty consistent (40-hour work weeks) but the days you were scheduled for were not (shifting schedules around happened a lot, and they often didn’t care about how many days it’d leave you working in a row...). If you were fulltime, you were eligible for health insurance coverage. Regardless if you were fulltime or parttime, you got a discount card for 10% that you can use in the store, and the pay ($11) was decent when you’re not overworked and working pretty much more than one persons job.","Management/supervisors could care less about your health and schedule. Attempts to inform them that you couldn’t work a certain amount of days in a row without getting sick went through one ear and out the other. They could rework the schedules to make it so you’re working 6-7 days in a row without reprieve, have two days off, then rework it again to the same thing, which is physically and mentally draining. They also didn’t care to hire new people often enough to replenish the people that left or get fired - so you’d often work an area by yourself with an area that’s too big to work by yourself and be finished by the end of the day, and you’d basically be working two or three peoples jobs.

Changes in the workplace are announced publicly before privately, and typically contain outright lies for PR reasons.
Manipulative management will attempt to have you believe you're underperforming while stocking well above targets.
Recently Walmart cut schedule distribution and department heads in half, doubling workload across the board with no pay rise.
Covid requirements not followed, management even discriminated against me for wearing a mask too often. I was also promised no customer interaction then scheduled on the floor during business hours.
Orientation is done by HR (People Lead) who are not familiar with the roles they train for. Nothing shown in orientation was actually relevant to my job, and I had to be shown around again once I was scheduled.
HR (People Leads) are incompetent and refuse to make changes requiring HR, even with the approval of my team lead, head coach, and at one point, the assistant store manager, which essentially meant I had to talk to 4-5 people to make even minor changes to my job and availability, each of which had different, ridiculous requirements.

Five points and you're out. You get one point if you have to miss a shift. Doesn't matter if you're sick or your kid is sick. You get half a point if you are more than nine minutes late. Doesn't matter if there's traffic or your kid is sick. If you miss three or more days of work for being sick or something, you get no points. How does that make sense? Points go away 6 months after you get that point.
Also specific to my store, and probably some others, my management has never actually worked as associates in this department. They run it very badly because of that. Also, they definitely play favorites. We have one guy in our department that doesn't do any work and actually hinders the department and is extremely rude to everyone he doesn't like which is 80% of the department, but he is best friends with one of the managers. If we even say something against this guy, they will find a way to fire us. In fact, they have fired almost all of the competent members of our staff in the past couple of months for saying things that the managers did not like. I brought it up to the manager above them and they just tried to make me move departments. And they will lie to cover up why the people were fired.
Lastly, I have a diagnosed anxiety disorder with panic attacks, but I am on medications. The other day, I had a panic attack during work about both work and other issues.

8168,1.0,Current Employee,If I could give it -5 stars I would.,You get a paycheck and health insurance. Hourly co workers are generally nice and hard working.,"Almost every aspect of the job is a con. Incompetent management that couldn't lead their way out of a paper bag, and don't make any effort to do much besides complain and hang out in the office all day. Can't motivate their employees to work properly, so they attempt to use fear to do so, instead of treating them like humans with emotions and feelings. Expect non management hourly employees to take on management roles without promotion so they can have someone else to blame for their own ineptitude. Create safety hazards to both customers and employees, but fail to address those that effect employees. Workload is ridiculous, and expectations totally unrealistic. They work good employees to the point of exhaustion, and don't train new ones so that the workload can be more evenly distributed. Pay long time employees the same as new hires, because everyone gets the same raise anytime one is actually given instead of basing it on quality of work. Home office is totally detached from how a regular store operates, and creates new systems, changes their minds, and then reverts back to essentially an old system. It's exactly what you would expect from a corporate giant such as Walmart, a total lack of empathy from the top down, and focused on ever increasing their already obscene profits at the expense of those who can't cope and burn out. This company makes you feel like you would rather die than come in for another day of emotional and physical abuse. This is that place, where hopes and dreams come to die.

8537,4.0,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",You can do this job...if you want to.,"Okay. I am a reasonable person. I do not hate this job. There are a few things that I think work.

1) Teamwork. Walmart just went through a restructuring. Department managers are a thing of the past. Instead, you have team leads like myself. I oversee 5 departments. The good thing about this is that it helps to break down the walls that divided the departments before. You no longer have department managers that are territorial over their own areas and people. There are only associates within each department. Associates are much more willing to bring variety to their days by assisting in a new way.
2) Technology makes the job super easy. I never really need training on anything. Every device I pick up is as easy as a self-checkout. Nothing I've ever done was ""hard.""
3) Room for advancement. Walmart will take you as far as you are willing to go. Even now, I am being asked about the next level up. You just have to want it. 
4) The people. The people of Walmart have their own stereotype...but I like them. The customer service interactions are a refreshing break for me at times. I get along with my coworkers as well. I feel like we are soldiers in a war at times...and that brings out a sense of brotherhood.
5) Fast days. You work hard and go home tired.","1) No victories. The volume of a Walmart Supercenter creates a neverending wave of stock. We have what's known as the dreaded ""2-truck night."" It's when the warehouse is backed up and sends an extra trailer to your store. These were supposed to end at Christmas, yet here I am on January 29th telling you we had three 2-truck nights this week. It's like trying to mop up the ocean. 
2) Callouts. So, remember what I said about associates being willing to add variety to their days? The best way they have discovered to do this is to stay at home. Imagine, if you will, being the team lead overseeing 3 service areas (paint mixer, fabric cutter, and gun sales) in addition to your other departments. Now, imagine a Saturday that you are working and your ENTIRE TEAM calls in from every department you oversee. You better learn to clone yourself.
3) Morale. The reason they are calling out is because everyone hates their jobs. It is exhausting, thankless work. If you are an upbeat, positive person, you will soon learn how to keep that to yourself.
4) Customer complaints. Go ahead, admit it....you have said that Walmart is greedy because they won't hire any cashiers. You may have angrily told that to a Walmart stockboy while you were 15th in line at checkout. Now go back and read my cons. There were 6 cashiers scheduled...none of them showed up. You told off that stockboy because his coworkers laid out.
5) Micromanagement. There are multiple coaches (formerly assistant managers) in a Walmart Supercenter. If you are a hard worker that comes to work, every single one of them needs you. You are asked to do things that have nothing to do with your area by people you do not directly report to. You have to learn to say ""no"" to your superiors...which is a weird thing.",2021-01-29, Team Lead

CONSTANTLY was spending 1/2 or more of my days at least half the week or more at times, sometimes ENTIRE shifts multiple days in a row forced to push carts because they were too cheap to hire more and too lazy/scared to fire the ones who weren't doing their freaking jobs or who just no called/no showed and didn't get fired for it/afraid if they did the horrible employees would come after them claiming discrimination even though they should easily have poor attendance or video footage of them wasting hours of time on the clock etc as evidence to dispute any such claims, etc. Not to mention the god-awful customers - screw the customers - some aren't bad, heck some are amazing, but at least a quarter to half on a given day were the rudest people ever and god help you when a Karen comes through or coupon-ers with their book trying to scam the store and trick new cashiers or just people that weren't gonna be happy and will lie right in front of your to CSMs or managers about you, etc. I could go on for literally days - but as said in pros - the ONLY good things about the job was the income and affordable insurance - and the income is still TERRIBLE - working 30-35 hours a week as a part timer for 4 years I was ONLY making $11.22 - maybe making $1100-1200 a month before taxes - with a roommate and an apartment that's under $600 a month TOTAL some months I was lucky if I had $30 bucks to spare - (should have been $11.66 by my count but every time they raised the base pay any annual raises you'd earn disappeared - granted you still made more than before but the whole thing about the annual raises was that it was a TINY little something for suffering another year in that crapshow - just cause the company chooses to increase pay shouldn't take that away imo - granted that wouldn't have drastically changed anything paycheck wise but still :P. Also, did I mention that if I didn't miss ONE day of work for the ENTIRE year - wasn't sick, didn't have to call out, leave early, have anything BESIDES a death in the immediate family - since you know - Walmart doesn't count aunts, uncles, nephews, nieces, cousins, etc as immediate family, even though grandparents - same degree of separation a parents sibling versus a parents' parent - since at least you get three days of bereavement - would net me a WHOPPING six MAYBE depending on hours and all - days of PTO that I could use TOTAL. I was there over four years and didn't EVER ONCE ask for any days off because I literally couldn't afford it.

9162,2.0,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",Meh,"Managers look the other way with everything. It's really hard to get fired for anything other than attendance, and even with that, you get chance after chance, especially if the managers ""like"" you. If you show up you can pretty much guarantee you'll be able to keep your job, unless they eliminate your job altogether. The whole chain of command is extremely corrupt and it makes it easy to get away with things like taking two-hour lunches, calling in and using personal time to do whatever you want or to come in super late, etc. Store managers tend to not notice you beyond your first month or so where they pump you up for the possibility of having a ""career."" This can be a pro or a con however you want to look at it. Just be aware that the only way you're actually going to move up the ladder is if you pucker up that kisser and use it every chance you get. The best way to kiss arse is to pretty much never take a day off. Or sleep with an asst manager or whatever they're called nowadays. I've seen that one work too. You get an hour lunch which is nice and two paid 15 min breaks. There are times where it's fun to work at Walmart, like when you go to the Academy for a week and they give you a gas card that you can use for whatever. Every once in a while, a cool manager comes along but quickly disappears, but while they're there you may learn different things about different departments. I found out that being properly cross-trained isn't encouraged, but when a string of people call off you'll always be asked to do their job, regardless of whether you've been trained to do that job or not, and leave your area unattended to go to s-it. The baseline philosophies of Walmart are actually something that I believed in: ""One Best Way."" But what it boils down to is the store managers run their stores however they choose, and I guarantee their preferences have poor Mr. Sam rolling in his grave. If you're hellbent on feeling superior, have an affinity for power trips, and aim to learn as little as possible about how the store is run, a store manager at Walmart is perfect for you. I must say you'll meet some of the sweetest ladies in the world at Walmart. They can make or break your shift, and uplift your spirit, and teach you a lot about life and help you realize there's a world outside of Walmart and it's not that serious.","The pay sucks. For example, Target starting pay is $4.00 more per hour. They eliminate positions and therefore get rid of people all the time. If you've had a coaching on your record and they just so happen to re-structure the system, 
 kiss your job goodbye. Turnover is laughably high from the bottom to the top. Because they don't ever discipline employees and give them a million chances to f-up, you can expect to habitually be overworked along with being underpaid. You'll be doing three people's jobs regularly. And if you don't know how to do their job, you'll get a thorough 5-minute training session, most likely from a manager who knows even less than you do and be thrown to the wolves. They seem to pride themselves on having up-to-date, technologically advanced equipment. But most of the time the crappy thing doesn't work, or has a dead battery, and then there's only one working and your supervisor has to steal it because they actually need it. Then they don't give it back, or leave it on a cart somewhere for another person to steal. As well, our cash recycler was a piece of utter garbage, despite being regularly cleaned and updated. It's the most frustrating thing for the employees and the customers, but has no overall effect on management, so they don't care. Another thing, Walmart is cheap and that equates to long lines, no cashiers, self-checkout only scenarios. They cut hours all the time and force people to go home if they're going to even get 20 minutes of overtime. Or they'll cut hours altogether and you'll end up with a roster of 5 people for the entire day to spread out across the entire front end. Sometimes cashiers would have to take my keys and cover my lunch because they don't schedule another manager with me like they're supposed to. I remember one day, when I was about 7 months pregnant, I stood on my feet for my entire shift- 10 hours- at the customer service desk. No breaks, no lunch. Nothing. The lines stretched to the back of the stores, and one of my morning cashiers closed her line and walked off (I am not being hyperbolic). I told her ""just go"" and continued to hack away at my customer service line. The petty, backstabbing politics are potent among the managers. Don't ever expect them to take your side in a disagreement or see anything from your perspective. If you receive a coaching, beware of open-dooring it. Especially if you go above the store manager's head because you're uncomfortable speaking to him. You'll have a target on your back for the rest of your time at Walmart. If you ever plan to transfer, do not make your store manager or direct supervisor aware until you've successfully mapped out a plan with the other store and spoken to that store's management. If they know you wish to transfer, they'll smile at you and wish you good luck. Then swiftly give you a ""bad grade"" on your evaluation, not tell you about it, and feed you some bulls-it line about how you need to work just a little harder, but you're doing okay, and please sign here. Always ask what your performance is rated at your evaluations. If you have a needs improvement rating, you can't transfer or move up. It's dangerous to work at Walmart. You'll be required to watch a video on how to get out alive if there's an active shooter. There's a reason you have to watch this training video several times a year. While I worked there, the El Paso shooting happened. There's no security at Walmarts and there were numerous bomb threats and ""scares"" following the tragedy in El Paso. They put a police officer at the door for about two weeks, and when everything died down they stopped paying for that, even though it greatly deterred shoplifters and general mischief. Lastly, they don't take sexual harassment seriously. I had a close friend transfer to another Walmart only to be regularly harassed by the store manager. When she reported it, corporate never so much as followed up with her. However, they did make the store manager aware, creating a volatile environment for her that resulted in her quitting. That disgusts me, and I can never respect a company that treats victims of sexual harassment (male and female) like they don't matter, and it's easier to not disrupt the daily goings-on. But, someone at corporate will take the time to be petty and give the store manager a head's up that one of his employees is accusing him of sexual harassment. Truly the trashiest, sleaziest, laziest, shadiest people I've ever associated with worked with me at Walmart. And those people were the ones who succeeded, despite numerous complaints to corporate and various confrontations with employees and even their girlfriends. I wouldn't wish a career at Walmart on my worst enemy. Ironically, one of my worst enemies, while I worked there, was the HR manager. I thank God every day they told me I couldn't come back. It was a shock and a bummer at first but what a blessing in disguise! I learned so much about myself but it was a painful, emotionally trying few years that I try so hard to look fondly upon.

9426,3.0,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",Definitely Not A Long Term Job,"- High pay for the area if you have no experience in anything, I literally mean nothing.
- Very fast hiring process
- Lots of overtime if you want extra pay
- Lots of choices for your schedule, weekends (3 /12 hr days) or weekdays (4/10 hr days - or 5/8 hr days) or a mix for swing shifts, this is for Full-time. Part-time would be 2 /12 hr days for weekend shift or 2.5 /10hr days for week day shift, however I dont think you can come in for overtime or get benefits if your part-time.
- You build up PTO fairly quickly after your 90 day probation period and you can use that whenever you like, regardless if your managers dont want you to, its one thing that is very worker orientated over there. When you have earned your time-off you can take it whenever you like, and thats that.
- Once you have been there a while you can switch to different positions within the DC and that can help build work-experience in other fields other than stacking boxes.","- Very strict on everything, down to the smallest detail, your not micro-managed by a person but by a automatic machine. It tracks everysingle thing you do; the tasks of your job, to using the bathroom. As in, there will be a gap in your time record and that needs to be made up or accounted for, its not uncommon to have your supervisors ask you where you where for that last 10 mins because you used the restroom. It uses time to account for every employees tasks and how efficient they are.
- There is an atomshphere of ""every employee is supposed to go above and beyond and do more work than nessesary"". If you do that you are treated fairly, however if you just show up for a paycheck and do your work and leave you are treated inferior, like you are not a good employee because you dont want to do extra work to make the supervisors look good. I saw a lot of this.
- Very short breaks
- A few tyrannical supervisors who get-off to dominating subordinates, the typical psychopaths
- Get fired for anything, however they dont ""fire"" you they just make your life miserable until you quite so you are not eligible for unemployment. Saw that a TON. The reason is because the most common job at the DC is terrible, pays well but is so brutal on your body that the turn-over rate is above 50%, its a churn-and-burn business. Take young people in, chew them up, spit them out if they cant handle it. It is what it is.",2021-03-29, Lift Driver (Walmart Distribution Center)

( though not many and not often) The company does have a strict ethics program to handle this but it would seem that some level of biases has slightly corrupted this over time, and as a result it can be ineffective at times. But by far the worst con that comes to my mind is sadly, the mind set of some of the people who do simply come into shop, but to verbally and emotionally abuse any employee in anyway that they can, leading up to and including threats of termination. Coworkers tend to get along but that doesn't stop them from being piety and bitter towards one another and some even go out out of their way to threaten one another employment and even go to extremes to intimidate one another if they feel that they are being challenged in anyway.
