I am saying this because this is not just another review from a \"disgruntled employee.\" I like Comcast, and want them to get better. \n\nThe onboarding commission was misleading. I thought I was going to be paid out at 100% for three months. Not only is this not enough time to build a book of business, but Comcast was misleading. 100% Month 1, 75% Month 2, and 50% month three is hardly enough to build a portfolio and a living in South Florida. This is one of the most expensive markets.\n\nThis is a review from a high-performing employee and I hope that the person who is reading this (and Comcast) takes this as honest constructive feedback. In hindsight I am ashamed of myself and why I have stayed with the company for so many years. I have unwittingly become part of the problem.\n\nComcast tells us to recruit small minority business partners (this is actually in our training- to target minority business owners) to enable them to sell residential services and then does not pay the Comcast Authorized Dealer (the business we signed up for). This has been an ongoing issue that the company is aware of for at least 6 years and has done nothing to fix it. The way Comcast gets around this is to hire a contractor (Actify or Leapfrog) and then pass the buck to them (it is their fault the partner is not getting paid). There have been literally times where dealers have come to me in tears due to the fact they have not received payment. In fact, during all my tenure at Comcast, I have never been able to reconcile a missed payment for a dealer. I am beginning to believe this is being done on purpose to exploit minority business partners because I have voiced my concerns to management over the past several years and nothing has been done about it. This is not a \"woke\" policy and needs to be closely looked at.\n\nAs an Indirect Account Executive if you do not \"recon\" a postpaid sale in a timely manner (before the sale is installed) the small business partner does not get paid. There is no system to pay the dealer. This makes you have to carry your company device at all hours of the day and night. This has caused significant mental health and physical health ailments because I have not been able to fully disconnect from my job in several years and caused me to be hospitalized on more than one occasion. I have not been able to go on a real vacation since I have been with the company. This has to do with dealer pay and account executive compensation. It is a major problem.\n\nComcast has missed employee commission paydays on more than two occasions causing myself and others to pay bills late and incur late charges. No explanation was given.\n\nThe overall comp for this position is below industry standards. I have exceeded large sales gains every year I have been with the company, and my pay gets lower and lower. There needs to be a better way to incentivize a salesperson. The way that goals have been calculated has never been properly explained in the Florida region. Your guess as to how I get paid is as good as mine. Many times goals have been loaded into Infoquest two and three weeks into the month making your ability to impact your commission check futile.\n\nI have no idea still as to what it takes to get a promotion here. I have applied two times for advancement, and I am well qualified. Both times NO feedback was given to me. This I feel is not a good use of company resources as all of us want to get better at our craft. Clear feedback should be given to candidates after you spend all the time necessary to properly prepare for an interview. Due to this happening to me multiple times I stopped applying for roles within the company. Comcast engages in talent hoarding.\n\nThere have been several occasions where Comcast has not paid out commissions to the Indirect team causing my bills to not be paid on time. There was no reasonable explanation for this.\n\nThere was no budget for prospecting. Prospecting and attending community networking events cost money and is necessary for you to find prospects that will sell Comcast residential products. This came out of my own pocket.\n\nThe title of your job is Indirect Account Executive. Management expects you to sell the services yourself to customers if you are not meeting goals. I am all for that EXCEPT that if I am going to be directly selling, I expect to be compensated accordingly. Direct sales agents that are successful make a salary well above the six-figure range (Indirect Account Executives cannot make this amount due to the way goals are set in the Florida region). Recently, management has delivered \"door hangers\" and expects the indirect team to hang these on people's residential homes to drive business into retail and small business partners. This is not a good use of our time.\n\nComcast compensates small business partners 80-90% less for selling a residential double play than competitors like AT&T. Why has the compensation for dealers so disparagingly different? \n\nInterdepartmental communication when it comes to Prepaid Service is a major issue. There are many defective prepaid modems that are sold to customers from Boost Stores. The policy is that if the modem is defective the customer is supposed to call customer care, and they will send the customer another modem in the mail. But, due to a communication problem that has not been resolved for several years the customer comes back to the Boost Store, causes a scene (Boost is not equipped to handle returns), and then they have to exchange the modem at their expense.\n\nI have sent several proposals to management about solutions to these issues and have never received a response. This is typical of the culture and lack of accountability at Comcast.\n\nDuring COVID-19 there were no leadership or teleconference meetings with our former senior manager. There seems to be a lack of inspirational leadership when we needed it the most.", "Management is hit or miss and can really turn a fulfilling job into a numbers grind that treats you like a cog."]},

So the only way to have a normal work-life balance is to be there long enough to gain a tenure team. Otherwise you are starting from ground zero with a fresh poorly performing team. Picture being told 3/4 of the year you are doing a great job, then the metrics that determine your future schedule, think 3-10 PM Tuesday-Wednesday off, comes up and your manager will tell you looks like you aren't doing a good job better make those numbers before your performance review. \r\n\r\nManagers will micro-manage every moment they can and confront you if you are not productive enough by 'their standards' not based on performance at all. It pays to do slow work and stretch out your 40+ hour work week. The longer it shows you working the better you are in their eyes.\r\n\r\nAgeism at its best. Anyone can see that if you look at the managerial team. Education does not matter because every manager only has a high school diploma and it shows very quickly. I'm not being condescending I am simply stating the truth. Skills do not matter. Loyalty for 10+ years and kissing all your bosses a**es in the same position is the only way to get promoted.\r\n\r\nManagers treat each supervisor different depending on their capabilities. Your co-worker could have a team 5 and you could have one of 15 and be paid the same but expected to do less because that is all 'they are capable of'. \r\n\r\nThe best of all if you want to be a detective and get off on firing people that take medical time off and wait for them to slip up in their documentation or say the wrong thing.

On top of that supervisors are told up-front they have to put 10s only otherwise they have no 'backbone'. And if the over manager score goes too low we have a team 'talking to' about owning our issues.\r\n\r\nFor career development you can't go anywhere because the reputation of call center employees is so bad in the company (and for a good reason) that no one will even entertain you for a phone screen for another role. \r\n\r\nIf you want leadership experience work anywhere else. A 2-3% raise every year is not worth your sanity.", "You will have managers that tell you to lie to customers faces during every interaction. Just to squeeze out a small rgu. My management threatened us with termination if we did not follow their policy. That policy is no mobile no promo. If they're not going to give you a sale, send them to customer service and tell them there are no promos available. Doesn't matter if its a 90 year old customer who's been waiting in line for an hour, who's significant other just died. If she doesn't want to walk out with an ipad, a cell phone, or give you another rgu, \"Tell her, unfortunately there are no promos in the store at this time, they're based around new mobile customers, here, I'll give you the customer service number.\" Rinse and repeat. If you didn't sell like that, you'd be pulled in the office and told you're replaceable. \r\n\r\nCan you make a good money? Sure. Not without blood on your hands. Might as well get a job as a car salesman and make even more. Same sleazy management and environment. This is company wide. I felt awful every day I came home from work. What an embarrassment. Can't believe I did their dirty work for so long. Not to mention, as a member of the LGBTQ community, I was utterly shocked and disgusted at the amount of racist, sexist and homophobic comments that were allowed to be a part of the culture for so long at that store. We had HR in the building constantly because of these issues. All of our minority and female employees had left because of how uncomfortable that environment made them. In 2021, in this troubling climate, full of hate and uncertainty, this... is uncalled for. I can't believe they would give us PRIDE and DIVERSITY pins, while letting these things go on, almost as if they were mocking these ideas. Awful. \r\n\r\nThe final straw was when a coworker assaulted me. Stabbed with a pen. Bled all over the place, on camera, with customers in the store. Had to go to the hospital. Comcast ended up firing the employee who did it right away , didn't offer to pay me a dime to cover my hospital bills and never answered my calls back. That was the final straw. Please, for your own dignity, and sanity, please stay as far away from Comcast as possible. Don't believe me? Fine. Just go take a look at what reddit has to say about them. Customers, former employees, current employees. Take a look at the \"criticisms of Comcast\" Wikipedia page. There's a reason they are one of the most hated companies in America. \r\n\r\nI worked there from 2018-2021."]}
