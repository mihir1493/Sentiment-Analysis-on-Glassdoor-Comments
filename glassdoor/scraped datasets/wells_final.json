The order below is random, no priority. \r\n\r\n#01 Poor business ethics. Any job working in the financial sector, especially larger institutions, requires the ability to ignore certain realities.\r\n\r\n#02 Double standards. This ties in with #01. Tech is required, as they should, to not have any unauthorized changes, not lose their laptop, follow processes accordingly, etc. Threats of termination for being out of compliance were directly relayed to me and my peers on the first day by our new vice president when WF acquired our smaller company. In my opinion, any infraction we do whether intended or not is not nearly as damaging as the questionable business practices executed by using the systems we are employed to keep running. \r\n\r\n#03 No clear paths for career advancement. Managers do not offer any career support; they are constantly worried/distracted about keeping their jobs; spend a lot of time in the trenches alongside their direct reports instead of being empowered to manage. \r\n\r\n#04 Unclear hiring practices. Sometimes the budget only allows hiring contractors, or hiring overseas, etc. Each time it can prevent internal candidates from advancement. This has affected me personally, where I ended up guiding a lower qualified new person in a higher role that I applied for.\r\n\r\n#05 Little to no pay raise/promotions within internal role. As a lead, I went over 10 years without a promotion and when it did happen, it was a blanket promotion.\r\n\r\n#06 Toxic working culture. Starts with management and goes on down. Rudeness on calls, hang ups, lack of accountability, no response to emails or chats, lack of professionalism with colleagues when requesting improvements. High performers will find themselves boxed out and being questioned for trying to go above and beyond. \r\n\r\n#07 Internal re-orgs take too much time. Tied to #05, if roles and responsibilites shift from one team to another, there isn't a clear path to make it happen. Some workers and managers choose to remain doing legacy functions, some do a hybrid of legacy/new functions. Anyone who wants to move forward will struggle with the pace of play.\r\n\r\n#08 Lack of using existing data. Management can request data be manually inputted in a separate system when that data is already attainable and more accurate via existing databases. Workers then have to manage multiple systems.\r\n\r\n#09 Overuse of email for work requests. Email is well past its prime. Internally there are a few widely known systems of record where requests can be submitted with built-in tracking, notifications, metrics, etc.\r\n\r\n#10 Confusing bureaucratic processes. Typical of any big company, a lot of work is subject to interpretation. Catch someone on a nice day, they'll help you avoid time-consuming order and approval forms. Going normal routes to request work is quite the journey and takes time away from interesting or more pressing tech work.\r\n\r\n#11 Reactionary unstructured approach to work. If an event happens, say a rare power outage at a critical site, it can derail all other important projects and force everyone to focus on disaster recovery in the moment. It isn't a problem to shift focus to respond to current conditions, it is a problem to shift focus without any strategy.\r\n\r\n#12 Unclear roles and responsibilities. It is good to have minimal boundaries in day to day work, as long as it is understood what your primary role is and what is expected of you. \r\n\r\n#13 Aging workforce is terribly slow to accept change, regardless of complexity.\r\n\r\n#14 Skills advancement/training is poor. There is an expansive library of internal courses with a cumbersome interface to use; not all courses are available at certain times, not all are free.\r\n\r\n#15 Agile methodologies lack vision and support. For those who aren't software developers, Agile is a major change to how you approach work each day. Some think Agile means \"just get it done fast, clean it up later\", instead of appreciating it as a formal method for efficiency. \r\n\r\n#16 The worst is always behind, better days ahead right?

We were given a chance to work remote temporarily for 4 months and they had announced it would be for Business PPP loans. I agreed to transfer roles from Personal Banker so I would have more exposure in that thinking it would be a temporary position that would last a few months. We go through training and it turns out they transferred us to a regular call center for customer service having nothing to do with PPP loans. It was a way for Wells Fargo to remove personal bankers and make room for more licensed bankers. Prior to my decision to work remote I was waiting to start my licensed banker training and the district manager had announced they removed sponsoring the license. Now I am stuck working in the call center within Wells Fargo and have all this PTO time that is impossible to schedule within a call center and there are no holiday hours because the call center is available 24/7. I wasn\u2019t the only Personal Banker that this happened to and several others were tricked into thinking it would be a temporary position to enhance our skills in Business. It was described as such by our District manager- and the licensed bankers who applied were the only people who were able to return from the \u201ctemporary position\u201d they were all called back in to their branches. When bankers started speaking up and we all communicated in training that this wasn\u2019t what we signed up for they \u201cescalated\u201d it to HR and we\u2019ve heard nothing since. The unfortunate part of this all is that call center locations are located in more rural areas and there is no call center in the state I am in. So what\u2019s going to happen to us that are not physically located near these call centers when everything opens up? Remote work is not going to be forever especially as a call center representative. I believe by then they will weed us out instead of furloughing us or firing us because the company wasn\u2019t doing well during COVID this is the tactic they used to displace us slowly since they didn\u2019t want any bad media for what they are doing to us. I wish they had just let us go before because we would have received unemployment benefits at the time since we didn\u2019t receive any bonus for working during covid as essential workers. They will end up giving us an ultimatum as things begin to reopen- either quit or move to the state where the call center location is open to resume work. We\u2019ll see how this scheme of theirs goes!"]},

Then WF bought us out and that was when I discovered what being in hell was like. They put on the mask like they were changing the company for the good but in reality employees were overworked and underpaid. The turnover was higher then any other company I have worked at. This was due to a combination of things, one was that new hires were not given enough training to feel confident to do the job, others could not keep up with the fast pace, some realized that the sales part of the job was the entire job and was lacking the customer service we were supposed to be giving. Then you have others being termed for mistakes, a lot were probably due to lack of training and or coaching so instead of coaching the employees they normally just termed them. The growth oppt. was very little unless you wanted to go from a teller to a sales position and manager only if another leaves. Don't even consider lead teller because the salary was barely higher then the teller. I recall countless times were entire stores were being termed due to gaming. I also recall countless times were others were sabotaging each other. The leaders acted more like ditators then partners. They would work against you instead of with you and thought that talking to everyone like they were a child would gain respect. The sales goals expected from the employees in every position were so unrealistic and over the top that I can see why so many were not interested in staying. Most would go work at other banks altogether where they could focus on the customer rather than focus on what else they can sell to them. After so many years of seeing this all unfold I felt that being in an environment where everyone around me was so toxic was not healthy. The above things that I shared were not things happening to me, these were observations and when I see things being done over and over and nothing ever changes (even when we have spoke up about it) then sometimes its better to move on. I decided to pursue other ventures. Leaving that company was the biggest weight off of my shoulders ever.

The pandemic has only made this trend worse.\r\n\r\nThe experiment started about 7 years ago. Two separate management chains, which only diverge about a level or two below the CEO. Offshore is completely unaccountable to anyone in the US, and their performance is abysmal. US employees take the blame for their mistakes and often have to work extra to fix them.\r\n\r\nWells has always had a bad time managing underperforming employees. Employees who routinely do the jobs of 3 or more people are never promoted or given raises, while those who do nothing climb the ladder quickly. With offshore, that is magnified 10 times. Most offshore managers only care to increase their headcounts, with no regard for actual delivery of work. The project I work on has steadily collapsed under their weight, as every US employee who leaves is replaced by 3 offshore employees who do literally nothing, if you are lucky. I have \"coworkers\" who haven't made a single check-in in over 3 years. They are being promoted.\r\n\r\nWhat we are now seeing is most of the valuable US employees being given negative performance reviews, including those who have literally done the work of 7 people for more than 5 years. Management does not care. They have targets to meet, and they will meet them.\r\n\r\nIt is abundantly clear the Wells Fargo is moving to a 100% offshore technology model at the expense of its US employees. We get no bonuses. We get no new hires. They get tons of bonuses for no work, and always seem to have new job reqs opening.\r\n\r\nIt. Is. Hell. Here. I'm literally just waiting until they lay me off so I can get a severance package. I hate every second of this place and cannot wait to leave."]},

Below are the things I enjoyed most.\r\nThe work is (mostly) meaningful, and sometimes treated as professionals by management. The people are technically savvy (some even smarter than myself, LOL) and really great to work with. I got along really well with most others, as long as we all focused on the premise that we are working for the same employer trying to accomplish roughly the same goal: building a better Wells Fargo one day at a time and one person at a time.\r\nThe pay is really good. Healthcare and related benefits are decent, but could be better. Paid holidays and PTO are satisfactory. Increasing PTO is a good way to keep employees. 401k matching to 6 percent is a gift, as was the ability to obtain an internal loan from the 401k balance was a lifesaver. \r\nThe corporate cell phone and other technical equipment made the work more bearable. Although some years were considered \"tight\" and expenses were minimized or eliminated, having a corporate cell phone to separate personal and business calls makes all the difference. Also, having an option for a MacBook was much better than not allowing them at all (Thank you for merging with Wachovia Bank), and also allowed me to perform calculations and programming much better than the Windows laptops.\r\nI enjoyed the 16 hours paid volunteer time, as well as matched donations to non-profits.

Instead, I was treated like a child until I raised my performance level, and was micro-managed for over a year, until laid off in December, 2020.\r\nNew upper management have raised several concerns and started workstreams/workgroups that will hopefully add some light at the end of the tunnel, however, it is a little too late for abuses that have already occurred and mindsets already set in stone. Despite the major abuses already discovered (2015 customer account abuses and subsequent regulation changes, 2009 Network Engineer burnout lawsuit, others), similar abuses still continue today due to the legacy Wells Fargo mindset to force employees to work until they burnout and leave, or are displaced at or above age 50. There are a few good managers, and most of the employees are awesome to work with, however, many have left or been pushed out due to lack of following with the marching orders.\r\nThere are no real career paths laid out, unless you want to become a political manager and move up the management chain of command. I and many others have suffered under this regime, and I have had little to no ability to move into the career path I really wanted. There was no time because I gave all of my energy and time to my day job, I was not given the opportunity to learn skills to move into the career I wanted to (no solid training courses or programs), and again, no tangible support from managers to help employees to grow.\r\nSome of the new strategies from executive management are good, but several do not make sense for a majority of the technical staff, such as the migration to BYOD. Such strategies make sense for securing Wells Fargo assets, however, leave the employees out to fend for themselves. What about employees who cannot afford the necessary technology to perform their job? What about employees with little knowledge or ability to secure their home network?\r\nCorporate technology that was paid for by Wells Fargo is increasingly watched and bogged down with security software to restrict and log every possible function, even if it is required by the job function or duties.

You get 1 shot at passing the SIE industry essentials, Series 7 & 66. Luckily for me I was able to pass them, if you fail any of these tests you will be let go from your contract. Once passing all the tests you will be interviewed for the role. The job is pretty much guaranteed at this point since they spent the money getting you licensed for the role. As most of you know already, these particular licenses enable you to provide financial advice regarding investments such as Mutual Funds. However, in this specific role you\u2019re unable to give any advice. There are 3 products you get to discuss with customers which would be a Wells Trade Account, Intuitive investor, or offering a phone based or full service FA. The customer has to decide which of these options is best for them. As the licensed associate you\u2019re not able to tell them what would be best, oftentimes this creates an awkward experience between you and the customer because they\u2019re looking at you to be the expert and know what would be best suited for them. The role is basic and becomes mundane fast. \r\n\r\nExpect to be taking back to back calls for your entire shift. \r\nExpect to repeat disclosures on every call. \r\nExpect your calls to be reviewed constantly and brought to your attention if you failed to state verbatim one of the 5+ disclosures. \r\nExpect to work Saturdays if you\u2019re new. \r\nExpect to be in the role for a very long time, I was in the role for 2 years. I was constantly looking to get into an analytical role. Despite being in the role 2 years I was unable to interview for any other position I applied for internally. As for my colleagues they experienced the same problems regarding internal promotions. \r\nExpect your manager to miss all your 1 on 1 meetings. \r\nExpect to be a number and a droid. \r\nExpect upset customers, as most customers resent WFA for the scandals and disorganized client services group. \r\nExpect to regret the job you have chosen. \r\n\r\nOn the final note I wanted to share the moment I was working Saturday in March 2020, when the COVID pandemic was on the rise and a stay at home order was issued by the NC governor. During work on Saturday a gentlemen in a hazmat suit showed up at my desk, informing me they would be spraying because someone in a nearby cubicle had been quarantined for being in close contact with someone who had COVID. My colleague and I, who were the only 2 scheduled at the Charlotte site on that particular Saturday were flabbergasted to say the least. My lazy employer failed to mention to us they were spraying the building that day for COVID. My manager asked me for a picture of the gentleman in the hazmat suit, I took the photo on my cellphone sent it to my boss. He told us to leave immediately and that we would be compensated for a full day of work. Later my boss calls my personal cell on my time to tell me the photos I have taken were illegally obtained, since I took the photos on private property. He asked me to delete the photos and call any of my family members I sent them to, so they could also delete them from their phones. Unbelievable, right? \r\n\r\nAnyway don\u2019t work for this company, anyone who currently works there in the ICC contact centers will be in my prayers.

They try to give you the time to take them all but no one ever does because they'd rather use that time to do other activities that help them either keep their job or keep from getting written up. The way they approach development and issues with your work is patronizing. Every meeting is just a series of questions that lead to another question that eventually lead to an explanation of how you're incompetent as an employee. They didn't say it, you say it, so its an HR friendly of telling you you suck, work harder. When you do get something right they pat you on the back and say nice but how come you didn't do this ALSO. The fear of lower level employees drives the lowkey intimidation all of management know they have. Everyone is SCARED to speak up in fear of retaliation. Then the company falls back on the most bogus no retaliation policy that comes way of those useless trainings and videos I mentioned before. So you speak up on the fact retaliation is still happening despite the policy and then the company hides behind an HR department that's suppose to protect you. HR is an absolute joke. Opened several claims to HR even in groups involving half the team members to no avail. Every answer back from them was a professional and corporate friendly way of saying, \"we understand and empathize with your problem but we don't agree, deal with it.\" or \"we understand we're going to talk to upper management\" then upper management sides with the people you have a problem with because they're buddies. \r\n\r\nRidiculous work expectations and performance that's globally expected due to the intimidation factor and complete lack of confidence and support. You will feel overworked and absolutely dread or fear coming to work \r\n\r\nDon't make any last minute or even 1-2 week plans in advance you have to ask for vacation 4 weeks in advance and still hope it doesn't interfere with anyone else's schedule\r\n\r\nSunday off but 2nd day off is completely random \r\n\r\nDon't even get me started on the WORST commission structure of all time. especially now that they're apologizing for opening fake accounts. And whatever commission you make gets paid 3 months later, what a joke. \r\n\r\nLastly depending on your location a certain ethnic group will most likely dominate the work place even up to higher management so you'll experience racism/favoritism to some guaranteed degree if you're not part of that group.

My District Manager stays at home 4/5 days a week and managed by emailing reports. I think I may see them once every other month which is not supportive of my career development. Unfortunately, this a trend from market to market. I\u2019m not sure what happens when someone becomes a DM... someone need to look at that.\n-As a Branch Manager, it can be difficult to complete your responsibilities due to staffing issues that never end. It\u2019s hard to be upset, because most of them move to different areas or get promoted. It\u2019s just really hard to get a posting for a new position. \n-Our teller and banker systems are outdated. They have errors and delay customer interactions on a daily basis.\n-There is no sales incentive for doing well. More times than not, a branch that has large volumes of customer traffic will always receive higher payout than smaller branches.  The customers literally come to those branches to apply for accounts. They way the incentive is made, branch balance totals are adjusted so frequently that you never understand if your branch is actually growing!  This makes it difficult for a manager to motivate their team to exceed customer expectations each day. I see where they\u2019re coming from.. why work harder when they\u2019re going to pay you incentive for just coming to work LOL.\n-The pay structure is silly. Like May companies, they make salary decisions based on how easy or difficult is will be to retain you.  So if I live in an area with less jobs equal to mine at other companies, they have a lower risk of me leaving and pay me less. If I live in an area with a lot of competition for my skills, they pay more. This causes team members to get paid less for the same job someone is doing in another area regardless of their work ethic. Raises? 1% if you perform, 2% if you exceed, 3% if you do some type of sexual favor for your boss if you can find them after they give you keys to the branch. I\u2019m kidding about the 3%. That\u2019s too generous for them. \n-The training has become the worst I\u2019ve ever seen at a company of this size. When I first began in 2012, they taught more in-depth material that allowed you to come into the branch with a basic idea of what you\u2019re doing. Now, my team members come in the branch with two weeks of questions to ask. Unfortunately, the manager has to then choose to do their tasks or support the team member by actually training them. Of course I choose my team members development which leads to extra hours in the Branch for myself after close for everything else. \n-I feel appreciated by upper management, but it\u2019s lip service most of the time. I think they expect my direct manager to do the leg work to make me feel valued and that\u2019s missing completely. After numerous positive customer reviews, the recognition I receive is only based on me teaching other people how to achieve the same business results. Can I at least get a breakfast muffin? Or even an empty bag with an imaginary muffin? Ok, well let\u2019s start with a thank you and go from there  :)\n-Geez look at the time - by now you may be thinking I\u2019m a disgruntled employee, but I\u2019m not.

The survey system is ridiculous, their opinion of your service is lumped right in with how the customer perceives Well Fargo.

They care more about you having quick calls than actually solving the customers' problems. They tell you in training don't worry about AHT because the customer experience is more important. But once you get out of training, if your AHT is high, which is normal, you will constantly get nagged over it and micromanaged. AHT is probably the most important metric to them because they say the company spends millions of dollars in operation costs every second you're on the phone. But if you don't completely solve the customer's probably they'll have to call back and take up more time. I've had managers give us tips for how to get customers off the phone before they bring up another thing they need help with so that you can meet the AHT metric. Bad business practice.\r\n-They sell you on the bonus you could get based on customer experience surveys. But even if you do really well in that, you won't get it even if your AHT is a couple seconds too high or if you had a QA dock and you're even a point off the requirement. But the rest of your team will still get a bonus based on the team's customer survey scores including your scores in the average.\r\n-Even if you get a high score in your schedule adherence, your ability to solve the customer's problem on the first call, high customer scores, high quality assurance scores, etc, if your AHT isn't perfect even if you've brought it down, you won't get any reward and very little recognition.\r\n-You get some good customers but you'll get a lot who scream at you, cuss at you, personally insult you and your intelligence, etc. and the company does little to prevent these types of customers from calling in and treating team members that way.\r\n-There's very little flexibility to actually help customers and I agree some policies aren't fair to them. Those are tough calls to take and you get them a lot.\r\n-No time to breath with maximum nine seconds between calls. Back to back for 8-10 hours. If you get up to use the bathroom outside of breaks it affects your schedule adherence. Every second of your time is micromanaged and you start to feel like a child and it's hard to regroup after a call.\r\n-Too many coachings. At least once a week, but can be multiple times a week. They  will also plug in and listen to your calls while you take them to coach you, which is very stressful and inefficient. The occasional coaching and performance review is good. But too often starts to feel overwhelming and like a punishment. I don't know any adults at their job who are coached that often.\r\n-Sometimes you will get a cool manager. Sometimes you will get one who micromanages worse than most and tracks you down to remind you to go to a meeting instead of trusting you to be an adult and check your own schedule. They will make you fill out unnecessary forms about your calls as you go through them. The will move you around on teams so if you get a good manager, don't get too comfortable.\r\n-If you go to a manager needing help for something with benefits, leaves, your schedule, etc, they will either give you incorrect info because they don't know much. Or they won't help you at all and claim there's nothing they can do for you when they can.\r\n-We once had a meeting with our manager's boss to give anonymous feedback. Beforehand said manager complained about anonymous feedback he was given previously. After the meeting, he talked to each employee individually and reworded the comments as questions to figure out who said what.\r\n-If you have advice for how something can be done better or how they can help you to do your job better, they won't listen to it because they \"have to\" do things the way they are\r\n-This job will ruin your mental health and make you anxious and drained all the time.

It should be noted that these points apply to Anti-Money Laundering only.\r\n\r\nManagement has been moving forward with a plan, despite widespread criticism at the investigator level, to move all teams to a 5 days in office/5 days working from home plan.  This plan would be so rigid as to force you to use your own PTO if you were unable to be in the office or work from home on your assigned week.  Our team has repeatedly been misled, beginning with our initial interviews, on the leniency of the company's work from home policy.  As our team has bounced between leaders, each has arbitrarily raised the required minimum days remaining on cases in our queue to prevent us from working remotely.  Leadership has also repeatedly dangled the prospect of across the board promotions to all Financial Crimes Consultant 2 team members to FC 3, however, as this has been in talks for over a year, and we are in yet another hiring freeze, this appears to be just another tall tale.  \r\n\r\nThere appears to be little to no room for advancement in Philadelphia, as financial crimes compliance is frequently subject to hiring freezes, and they appear to be pushing to remove us physically from the building based on the above working from home plan.\r\n\r\nThis theme of arbitrary leadership decisions is a problem across all aspects of our work, and is exacerbated by the clear lack of industry knowledge and proper priorities for compliance investigations groups at all levels of management on the East Coast, but particularly at the manager and director level.  Wells Fargo's program requires each and every case to be scrutinized by your direct manager, who often apply their own questionable nitpicks to what should be a streamlined, consistent production-based environment.  Some managers have next to no financial crimes experience, knowledge of company systems, or leadership skills.  If you are used to any autonomy in your investigative work, you will hate it here.  This is the only investigative group I've been a part of where the managers have no cases of their own to complete, and are essentially QR (even though there is an actual QR with much more lenient standards as they service all teams). \r\n\r\nThese huge inconsistencies between teams are the result of an overall lack of written policies and procedures I had never encountered in a compliance program before coming to Wells Fargo.  What little written guidance there is is often supplemented by verbal updates from leadership with questionable understanding of the issues at hand, and often are never even added in writing to the compliance manuals.  Teams with the same pay grade, investigative mandates, and case loads are hugely inconsistent across the company to a level I had not though imaginable.  This can mean the difference between one team only having to review a single account for a month time span, with another team for the same referral having to review 20 accounts over a year.  There appears to be an established culture of managers and directors with no real productive casework to do, who are encouraged to add their own anal guidelines for their respective teams down the chain.  Every single policy change I have seen, at the director or manager level, has consisted of them adding more work for us to do, or curtailing our privileges.  It is especially insulting having compliance experience in mature programs and knowing that these changes are never actually the result of guidance stemming from the federal government or an audit, but middle managers seeking to appear more strict and thorough than the next, as they view our teams as another stepping stone to move up.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia morale remains low as our teams are again and again subject to rules which we see our colleagues in other regions, lucky enough to be under qualified leadership, not have to deal with.  Management holds us to the quantitative standards of a high volume production environment, and appears unable to create efficient processes to succeed with that level of case work.  Our case load has increased unbelievably in our time, from what was an expected 3 cases completed per day, to what is now 5.  It is impossible to conduct in depth reviews given that volume yet managers constantly push for more to be completed.  We feel that we are always bearing the burden of management's lack of planning which caused this situation, as we are constantly understaffed, and see arbitrary priority level escalations, new monitoring referral sources, and ill-conceived policies be implemented every day.", "After 18 years of working here, I am seeing all back office jobs move to countries where the labor is less expensive. The managers responsible for all that you read about are still here, just in different management roles. You really think they're not going to find a way to cheat?  I would not be surprised if we all hear something else within the next 12 months.", "Wells Fargo has unethical sales practices. They teach you to Target those who are vulnerable to making poor financial choices so that they can push them into new loans and credit cards. The business model is focused on sales, not service. You have to offer products to every customer who comes in. Customers were often frustrated with the pestering. The good, honest, kind employees were pushed out while the aggressive, unethical employees were promoted.", "Base salary only given for first few months.", "The salaries and career options are changing.", "Constantly in the news, deal with some frustrated customers. Most management is average. Not much movement into higher roles.", "Recent public issues and regulatory commitments have led to significant change which is hopefully for the better.
