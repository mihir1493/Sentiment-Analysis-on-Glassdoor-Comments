This varies from store to store, but often times you will find yourself among wholesome and diverse coworkers who may not care much about the company, but will care a lot about you (management is hit or miss here).\n* Benefits. If you're full-time, expect benefits after your probationary period (between 30 and 90 days). If you're part-time, you might as well go for open enrollment because it takes 12 months to get benefits.\n* Transferrable.

Most people view Walmart very poorly and will extend that perception onto associates in a manner where it's outright abuse.

I am a reasonable person. I do not hate this job. There are a few things that I think work.\r\n\r\n1) Teamwork. Walmart just went through a restructuring. Department managers are a thing of the past. Instead, you have team leads like myself. I oversee 5 departments. The good thing about this is that it helps to break down the walls that divided the departments before. You no longer have department managers that are territorial over their own areas and people. There are only associates within each department. Associates are much more willing to bring variety to their days by assisting in a new way.\r\n2) Technology makes the job super easy. I never really need training on anything. Every device I pick up is as easy as a self-checkout. Nothing I've ever done was \"hard.\"\r\n3) Room for advancement. Walmart will take you as far as you are willing to go. Even now, I am being asked about the next level up. You just have to want it. \r\n4) The people. The people of Walmart have their own stereotype...but I like them. The customer service interactions are a refreshing break for me at times. I get along with my coworkers as well. I feel like we are soldiers in a war at times...and that brings out a sense of brotherhood.\r\n5) Fast days. You work hard and go home tired.", "The three day work week", "Good work people environment security", "Easy hours and not stressfull", "I\u2019m grateful they gave me the opportunity when nobody did . I appreciate Walmart and there professional managers", "You can change your schedule as you'd like. They will guilt trip you into not doing it and threaten to cut back your hours. I never actually saw my hours get cut however.", "For unskilled labor, it pays much better than others. It is also consistent and COVID-proof work. There are opportunities to move up if you really want it, and your job will never be in jeopardy if you show up on time and do the bare minimum that they ask you to do."], "cons": ["Managers do not care about you; your department will mostly likely be understaffed most of the time; my managers did not care if I was in school.", "None. I\u2019m blessed to be employed", "Unreliable co-workers causing other to do more work.", "1) No victories. The volume of a Walmart Supercenter creates a neverending wave of stock. We have what's known as the dreaded \"2-truck night.\" It's when the warehouse is backed up and sends an extra trailer to your store. These were supposed to end at Christmas, yet here I am on January 29th telling you we had three 2-truck nights this week. It's like trying to mop up the ocean. \r\n2) Callouts. So, remember what I said about associates being willing to add variety to their days? The best way they have discovered to do this is to stay at home. Imagine, if you will, being the team lead overseeing 3 service areas (paint mixer, fabric cutter, and gun sales) in addition to your other departments. Now, imagine a Saturday that you are working and your ENTIRE TEAM calls in from every department you oversee. You better learn to clone yourself.\r\n3) Morale. The reason they are calling out is because everyone hates their jobs. It is exhausting, thankless work. If you are an upbeat, positive person, you will soon learn how to keep that to yourself.\r\n4) Customer complaints. Go ahead, admit it....you have said that Walmart is greedy because they won't hire any cashiers. You may have angrily told that to a Walmart stockboy while you were 15th in line at checkout. Now go back and read my cons. There were 6 cashiers scheduled...none of them showed up. You told off that stockboy because his coworkers laid out.\r\n5) Micromanagement. There are multiple coaches (formerly assistant managers) in a Walmart Supercenter. If you are a hard worker that comes to work, every single one of them needs you. You are asked to do things that have nothing to do with your area by people you do not directly report to. You have to learn to say \"no\" to your superiors...which is a weird thing.", "The management was not very helpful", "Work hard pay holidays off", "It didnt seem like there was room for advancement", "Nothing that I can complain about", "No one knows what they're doing from the top down.

It's really hard to get fired for anything other than attendance, and even with that, you get chance after chance, especially if the managers \"like\" you. If you show up you can pretty much guarantee you'll be able to keep your job, unless they eliminate your job altogether. The whole chain of command is extremely corrupt and it makes it easy to get away with things like taking two-hour lunches, calling in and using personal time to do whatever you want or to come in super late, etc. Store managers tend to not notice you beyond your first month or so where they pump you up for the possibility of having a \"career.\" This can be a pro or a con however you want to look at it. Just be aware that the only way you're actually going to move up the ladder is if you pucker up that kisser and use it every chance you get. The best way to kiss arse is to pretty much never take a day off. Or sleep with an asst manager or whatever they're called nowadays. I've seen that one work too. You get an hour lunch which is nice and two paid 15 min breaks. There are times where it's fun to work at Walmart, like when you go to the Academy for a week and they give you a gas card that you can use for whatever. Every once in a while, a cool manager comes along but quickly disappears, but while they're there you may learn different things about different departments. I found out that being properly cross-trained isn't encouraged, but when a string of people call off you'll always be asked to do their job, regardless of whether you've been trained to do that job or not, and leave your area unattended to go to s-it. The baseline philosophies of Walmart are actually something that I believed in: \"One Best Way.\" But what it boils down to is the store managers run their stores however they choose, and I guarantee their preferences have poor Mr. Sam rolling in his grave. If you're hellbent on feeling superior, have an affinity for power trips, and aim to learn as little as possible about how the store is run, a store manager at Walmart is perfect for you. I must say you'll meet some of the sweetest ladies in the world at Walmart. They can make or break your shift, and uplift your spirit, and teach you a lot about life and help you realize there's a world outside of Walmart and it's not that serious.", "Decent benefits, insurance could be better.

You are just a number and noone cares about you, you can and will be replaced.", "The pay sucks. For example, Target starting pay is $4.00 more per hour. They eliminate positions and therefore get rid of people all the time. If you've had a coaching on your record and they just so happen to re-structure the system, \r\n kiss your job goodbye. Turnover is laughably high from the bottom to the top. Because they don't ever discipline employees and give them a million chances to f-up, you can expect to habitually be overworked along with being underpaid. You'll be doing three people's jobs regularly. And if you don't know how to do their job, you'll get a thorough 5-minute training session, most likely from a manager who knows even less than you do and be thrown to the wolves. They seem to pride themselves on having up-to-date, technologically advanced equipment. But most of the time the crappy thing doesn't work, or has a dead battery, and then there's only one working and your supervisor has to steal it because they actually need it. Then they don't give it back, or leave it on a cart somewhere for another person to steal. As well, our cash recycler was a piece of utter garbage, despite being regularly cleaned and updated. It's the most frustrating thing for the employees and the customers, but has no overall effect on management, so they don't care. Another thing, Walmart is cheap and that equates to long lines, no cashiers, self-checkout only scenarios. They cut hours all the time and force people to go home if they're going to even get 20 minutes of overtime. Or they'll cut hours altogether and you'll end up with a roster of 5 people for the entire day to spread out across the entire front end. Sometimes cashiers would have to take my keys and cover my lunch because they don't schedule another manager with me like they're supposed to. I remember one day, when I was about 7 months pregnant, I stood on my feet for my entire shift- 10 hours- at the customer service desk. No breaks, no lunch. Nothing. The lines stretched to the back of the stores, and one of my morning cashiers closed her line and walked off (I am not being hyperbolic). I told her \"just go\" and continued to hack away at my customer service line. The petty, backstabbing politics are potent among the managers. Don't ever expect them to take your side in a disagreement or see anything from your perspective. If you receive a coaching, beware of open-dooring it. Especially if you go above the store manager's head because you're uncomfortable speaking to him. You'll have a target on your back for the rest of your time at Walmart. If you ever plan to transfer, do not make your store manager or direct supervisor aware until you've successfully mapped out a plan with the other store and spoken to that store's management. If they know you wish to transfer, they'll smile at you and wish you good luck. Then swiftly give you a \"bad grade\" on your evaluation, not tell you about it, and feed you some bulls-it line about how you need to work just a little harder, but you're doing okay, and please sign here. Always ask what your performance is rated at your evaluations. If you have a needs improvement rating, you can't transfer or move up. It's dangerous to work at Walmart. You'll be required to watch a video on how to get out alive if there's an active shooter. There's a reason you have to watch this training video several times a year. While I worked there, the El Paso shooting happened. There's no security at Walmarts and there were numerous bomb threats and \"scares\" following the tragedy in El Paso. They put a police officer at the door for about two weeks, and when everything died down they stopped paying for that, even though it greatly deterred shoplifters and general mischief. Lastly, they don't take sexual harassment seriously. I had a close friend transfer to another Walmart only to be regularly harassed by the store manager. When she reported it, corporate never so much as followed up with her. However, they did make the store manager aware, creating a volatile environment for her that resulted in her quitting. That disgusts me, and I can never respect a company that treats victims of sexual harassment (male and female) like they don't matter, and it's easier to not disrupt the daily goings-on. But, someone at corporate will take the time to be petty and give the store manager a head's up that one of his employees is accusing him of sexual harassment. Truly the trashiest, sleaziest, laziest, shadiest people I've ever associated with worked with me at Walmart. And those people were the ones who succeeded, despite numerous complaints to corporate and various confrontations with employees and even their girlfriends. I wouldn't wish a career at Walmart on my worst enemy. Ironically, one of my worst enemies, while I worked there, was the HR manager. I thank God every day they told me I couldn't come back. It was a shock and a bummer at first but what a blessing in disguise! I learned so much about myself but it was a painful, emotionally trying few years that I try so hard to look fondly upon.
