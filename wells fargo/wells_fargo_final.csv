While they present an attractive image in their mission and value statements, the reality is quite different - the majority of people you interact with are dispirited, disillusioned, mentally exhausted, and unmotivated. They are just treading water until it is time to retire.

I have been in business for 27 years and worked previously at Wells over 20 years ago. The amazing thing is they have not grown as an organization in those past two decades. The same dominance-based structure is firmly in place - one that withholds information from the employees in order to allow the managers to feel they are in control. Perhaps they believe they are adding value? It is a pretty sad state of affairs when territorialism and protecting your image are the main goals of the so-called leadership (in actuality, 'rudderless ship' is the best analogy). Saul van Beurden is very compelling and seems open minded and helpful - but the reality is you will never work for anyone like him. Your managers will be barely literate and emotionally stunted individuals who never say 'Thank You' or acknowledge your work ('No, folks - a paycheck really is not enough!').

Purportedly they are implementing Agile but it is really Agile in name only; the teams are completely disempowered and unable to plan given the shifting requirements and paucity of information. Again, it feels like this is a control issue where the many levels of weak management don't want to face their approaching obsolescence.

-Good amount of vacation days; ability to carryover unused balance
-Good retirement/health care plans
-Recently higher level mgmt positions turned over; coin flip whether it will improve decades long issues in multiple areas (see Cons*)","Will try to be objective as possible, these are my 20+ year experience and observations from a direct role in infrastructure tech to interacting with software developers, business system consultants, tech/project managers and support desks. The order below is random, no priority. 

#01 Poor business ethics. Any job working in the financial sector, especially larger institutions, requires the ability to ignore certain realities.

#02 Double standards. This ties in with #01. Tech is required, as they should, to not have any unauthorized changes, not lose their laptop, follow processes accordingly, etc. Threats of termination for being out of compliance were directly relayed to me and my peers on the first day by our new vice president when WF acquired our smaller company. In my opinion, any infraction we do whether intended or not is not nearly as damaging as the questionable business practices executed by using the systems we are employed to keep running. 

#03 No clear paths for career advancement. Managers do not offer any career support; they are constantly worried/distracted about keeping their jobs; spend a lot of time in the trenches alongside their direct reports instead of being empowered to manage. 

#04 Unclear hiring practices. Sometimes the budget only allows hiring contractors, or hiring overseas, etc. Each time it can prevent internal candidates from advancement. This has affected me personally, where I ended up guiding a lower qualified new person in a higher role that I applied for.

#05 Little to no pay raise/promotions within internal role. As a lead, I went over 10 years without a promotion and when it did happen, it was a blanket promotion.

#06 Toxic working culture. Starts with management and goes on down. Rudeness on calls, hang ups, lack of accountability, no response to emails or chats, lack of professionalism with colleagues when requesting improvements. High performers will find themselves boxed out and being questioned for trying to go above and beyond. 

#07 Internal re-orgs take too much time. Tied to #05, if roles and responsibilites shift from one team to another, there isn't a clear path to make it happen. Some workers and managers choose to remain doing legacy functions, some do a hybrid of legacy/new functions. Anyone who wants to move forward will struggle with the pace of play.

#08 Lack of using existing data. Management can request data be manually inputted in a separate system when that data is already attainable and more accurate via existing databases. Workers then have to manage multiple systems.

#09 Overuse of email for work requests. Email is well past its prime. Internally there are a few widely known systems of record where requests can be submitted with built-in tracking, notifications, metrics, etc.

#10 Confusing bureaucratic processes. Typical of any big company, a lot of work is subject to interpretation. Catch someone on a nice day, they'll help you avoid time-consuming order and approval forms. Going normal routes to request work is quite the journey and takes time away from interesting or more pressing tech work.

#11 Reactionary unstructured approach to work. If an event happens, say a rare power outage at a critical site, it can derail all other important projects and force everyone to focus on disaster recovery in the moment. It isn't a problem to shift focus to respond to current conditions, it is a problem to shift focus without any strategy.

#12 Unclear roles and responsibilities. It is good to have minimal boundaries in day to day work, as long as it is understood what your primary role is and what is expected of you. 

#13 Aging workforce is terribly slow to accept change, regardless of complexity.

#14 Skills advancement/training is poor. There is an expansive library of internal courses with a cumbersome interface to use; not all courses are available at certain times, not all are free.

#15 Agile methodologies lack vision and support. For those who aren't software developers, Agile is a major change to how you approach work each day. Some think Agile means ""just get it done fast, clean it up later"", instead of appreciating it as a formal method for efficiency.

I would also question some of the strategic decisions by management. Just a small example. Wells sold its 401k administration business to Prudential. Then, they selected a different vendor (Empower) to administer their 401k plan going forward. Empower does not have any electronic connectivity to Wells Fargo Advisors (apparently Wells is one of the few brokers that does not have electronic connectivity to Empower). Wells sells this business to a vendor that they themselves are not willing to use going forward, and then they pick an alternative that can't easily roll 401k accounts over their internal brokerage operation. Who makes these decisions?",2021-09-01, Director

1911,2.0,Former Employee,Good to Great to Nowhere,My colleagues at Wells Fargo were very professional and made my time there the highlight of my banking experience. Prior to the scandal the bankâs leadership outside of consumer banking had much more authority and the banks ability to be competitive was fun and winning meaningful relationships and positively impacting customers was commonplace. After the scandal became the central focus it was a completely different work place for all areas of the bank which 95% of the bank had nothing to do with the account scandal. The former leader of the consumer side of the business and her unquestioned support from the CEO of the bank at that time was the downfall for this organization.,"The bank lost its direction after the account scandal broke. No one employee including the CEO (he was in denial) really understood the changes that would be forthcoming once the effects of this fully took effect. The bank no longer was in control of its narrative nor was it capable of communicating to its employees what was going on with its regulatory enforcements that never stopped coming. Being an employee at Wells Fargo is not something I would recommend to anyone in the next few years unless you are looking for mission impossible and your work will never culminate into a feeling of satisfaction. My role was the tip of the spear in helping the bank bring in new customer relationships. As part of the banks effort to appease a multitude of its regulatory issues, the bank set up a number of safety towers or silos (operating separately of one another). This sounds like it was a good idea, but because the leaders of these various silos operated independently of each other and did not communicate it was a complete nightmare to get anything done productive and help create positive outcome. The time it took to board a new relationship is typically many months and not weeks as most banks board new clients. The culture of the bank has become one of fear and uncertainty. By in large there are fewer senior experienced bankers working as they are leaving for other opportunities. By in large, turnover is not occurring in higher salaried enployees despite the dysfunction because they wonât have someone pay them what they make at WF. The higher paid employees typically comprised of senior leadership are under tremendous pressure as their top performers are running over them getting out the door.",2021-07-31, Business Owner

Those benefits made up for working very long hours, having to work unexpectedly during PTO, skipping a lunch break to eat on mute during back-to-back meetings, etc. When you have to work 8am-7pm regularly as a salaried employee, being able to do so at home makes it sting a lot less. Now that they are taking away the ability to work from home most days, I can't imagine how I will get all of the work done and commute home in time to start dinner, exercise, take care of kids, etc. just to wake up, sit in traffic, and do it all over again. I'm going to have to start saying no to the new assignments that come to me at 5pm and are due at 8am. Taking away the ability for high performing/producing employees to spend their long workdays at home is really disappointing. Especially when we've been doing it for over a decade, and other companies are offering it even more now. Other benefits have also been taken away recently - no raises last year for certain level of employees, no 401K match until Dec 31, cell phones taken away, laptops are next.

Working in person, the campus on which training took place was really cool and had all kinds of things that made being at work convenient. I could have easily lived in that building if such a thing were allowed. I hope other locations are anything like it.","Training was simultaneously very thorough and very sink-or-swim at the same time. I felt mostly prepared going into the role but once I was on the floor taking calls I realized quickly how much had been left out. There were a great deal of important job functions that weren't covered in training that I and the others who trained with me had to ask coworkers about. 

Time on the phones and time in general was very micromanaged down to the minute. If you spent too long on a call or too long in wrap it was only a matter of time until someone was on the case about it no matter how reasonable it was or how detailed the notes were. This isn't necessarily true of the company as a whole but in my role with my boss I felt as though my failures were recognized disproportionately to my successes.

At the time that I was working with Wells Fargo the company was in the news a lot for any number of scandals. We were always being emailed about them and briefed on how to respond if certain things came up in conversation, or how to redirect them to a team geared to speak with the media and things like that. It was frustrating having to keep on top of it all, especially when most of it had nothing to do with my role whatsoever.

Lastly, collections for home mortgage was just a distressing job. That isn't Wells Fargo's fault but it's true of the role even so. It was difficult to hear people talk about the massive obstacles in their life getting in the way of them paying their home loan and hearing their distress in being told they're at risk of losing their home if they don't pay, and there's only so much we as employees can do about that. Being unable to help people beyond a certain extent when their only wrongdoing is not having money to live on felt terrible and acknowledging that on the floor felt like an admission of weakness.

You get great employee benefits and amazing PTO time
You get a discounted rate if you need to take a loan out from your retirement
Long maternity leave",If you plan on moving up there are many empty promises even if you put in the work. We were given a chance to work remote temporarily for 4 months and they had announced it would be for Business PPP loans. I agreed to transfer roles from Personal Banker so I would have more exposure in that thinking it would be a temporary position that would last a few months. We go through training and it turns out they transferred us to a regular call center for customer service having nothing to do with PPP loans. It was a way for Wells Fargo to remove personal bankers and make room for more licensed bankers. Prior to my decision to work remote I was waiting to start my licensed banker training and the district manager had announced they removed sponsoring the license. Now I am stuck working in the call center within Wells Fargo and have all this PTO time that is impossible to schedule within a call center and there are no holiday hours because the call center is available 24/7. I wasnât the only Personal Banker that this happened to and several others were tricked into thinking it would be a temporary position to enhance our skills in Business. It was described as such by our District manager- and the licensed bankers who applied were the only people who were able to return from the âtemporary positionâ they were all called back in to their branches. When bankers started speaking up and we all communicated in training that this wasnât what we signed up for they âescalatedâ it to HR and weâve heard nothing since. The unfortunate part of this all is that call center locations are located in more rural areas and there is no call center in the state I am in. So whatâs going to happen to us that are not physically located near these call centers when everything opens up? Remote work is not going to be forever especially as a call center representative. I believe by then they will weed us out instead of furloughing us or firing us because the company wasnât doing well during COVID this is the tactic they used to displace us slowly since they didnât want any bad media for what they are doing to us. I wish they had just let us go before because we would have received unemployment benefits at the time since we didnât receive any bonus for working during covid as essential workers. They will end up giving us an ultimatum as things begin to reopen- either quit or move to the state where the call center location is open to resume work. Weâll see how this scheme of theirs goes!,2021-04-19, Personal Banker I

People are normally very willing to help you. Has some good benefits like 4 months paid parental leave. Once you get in you can move around somewhat easily. work/life balance is good unless you are an analyst of some sort.,Poor company/staff moral. Lots of layoffs and on the banking side you are forced to reapply for the job you currently have. No surprise when the keep only the people they can pay less. If you are in a field that isn't banking specific then the upper level management runs the show but doesn't know how things operate at the lower levels. In the WF tech world its normal to see managers overseeing an engineering group who have no engineering experience. Mid level/upper level management in tech fields are normally MBA's with a finance background who know little about the systems they support. Most of the systems and processes make no sense. Every 2-3 years everything changes depending on who's in charge and before the dust settles it changes again... usually to the way it was prior. You can bet that management will always go for the cheaper option vs the better option. Scandal after scandal after government mandate was caused by poor sr. management.

So, they're hard pressed for time other than when they do get around to meet with you for your monthly meeting, and any other meetings where they reward your competency by asking you to help unclog a backlog, or ask you to give ideas on how you can prevent mistakes from occurring again.
Everyone's overloaded, but the pressure on the grunts where jobs actually land is immense. Then jobs are reassigned to competent saps who show up to work every day.

Things were continuing to get worse as time went on and I felt that these factors were making doing the audit with a reasonable standard of competency impossible. I was told that other audit associates had different experiences on their teams but this was also told to me by the recruiter during what was effectively an exit interview. Training is very inconsistent in quality and depends largely on which audit team you are assigned.

The work itself is fairly easy but it requires accessing multiple systems of record and these are not intuitive systems that you'll be able to find by guesswork. You'll need training on how to do all of this as well and that was largely the problem I ran into with my team.

This is not an HR role anymore. 

If you value having a high paying job, this is it! Other than that, nothing special about the role. They took a simple job and over complicated it and never asked us for our opinions. 

New processes almost weekly because âthe regulatorsâ say so, but no explanations given. 

You will be handling mostly customer related cases where the customer is mad at every little thing. 

This role is lucky to have any type of âHRâ work to it. 

Management does not seem to care about the numerous redundant processes in place. 

Good luck trying to get anything more than meeting expectations, even though, they assign 3 new cases each week on top of your already growing case load.

Example Set 1: Having your work badge sent to the wrong city, having inoperable devices dropped on your desk, and not having the tech staff show up to be sure your systems are working until after you have done their job for them in the first week.
Example set 2: Having systems so slow they compete with dialup speeds, and you are doing jobs that require processing of tens of thousands of records. This is only one example of how the company will routinely set you up without what you need. It would be about the equivalent of a mechanic being asked to fix a car with their bare hands and hardly any tools.
Example Set 3: Constant hypocracy. Transparency, candidness, honesty are talked about frequently as company values. On the flip side, there is a compliance department that requires you to disclose all of your investment activity without even telling you what they are doing with it, or informing you about who has access. If you bother to express your dissatisfaction in a candid manner, you are reprimanded because nobody is to dare challenge that department. 
I could go on and on. You will find constantly you are told to follow one process, and then before even giving you enough time to switch, the company will change processes not giving you the chance to adjust, or even get the right footing. There are processes in place that might even be illegal (like the surveillance of your investments). You will not find more sloppy communication than what you will see here.

Ultimately a lot of your experience at WF will depend on your Branch Manager. Branch Managers are promoted based on meeting sales goals, not their skill at managing teams.

A lot has been done to repair the company's image. But employee morale is at an all-time-low with layoffs, quotas (yes, they still exist), and increasing micromagement.

You MIGHT get to work from home after your three months of training is up IF theyâre still keeping people at home due to the pandemic. Otherwise, youâre stuck in a small cubicle.","Pretty much everything else
You donât get enough training and canât use that as a valid excuse for when you make any mistake
You will be audited twice every month when you get out of training and things begin to count against you. Once youâre out of training, you canât get below 97% accuracy a month (which equates to literally no mistakes because of the way audits are weighted) and if you fail your audits 5 out of a 6 month rolling period, youâre done. Thereâs no question or review as to how little your mistakes were or how nit picky the quality audit team was, youâre just fired. 
They keep raising the quality audit bar to make it almost impossible to pass every every month. Seems that they would rather fire people for âqualityâ instead of just laying off from a VERY busy department

Then WF bought us out and that was when I discovered what being in hell was like. They put on the mask like they were changing the company for the good but in reality employees were overworked and underpaid. The turnover was higher then any other company I have worked at. This was due to a combination of things, one was that new hires were not given enough training to feel confident to do the job, others could not keep up with the fast pace, some realized that the sales part of the job was the entire job and was lacking the customer service we were supposed to be giving. Then you have others being termed for mistakes, a lot were probably due to lack of training and or coaching so instead of coaching the employees they normally just termed them. The growth oppt. was very little unless you wanted to go from a teller to a sales position and manager only if another leaves. Don't even consider lead teller because the salary was barely higher then the teller. I recall countless times were entire stores were being termed due to gaming. I also recall countless times were others were sabotaging each other. The leaders acted more like ditators then partners. They would work against you instead of with you and thought that talking to everyone like they were a child would gain respect. The sales goals expected from the employees in every position were so unrealistic and over the top that I can see why so many were not interested in staying. Most would go work at other banks altogether where they could focus on the customer rather than focus on what else they can sell to them. After so many years of seeing this all unfold I felt that being in an environment where everyone around me was so toxic was not healthy. The above things that I shared were not things happening to me, these were observations and when I see things being done over and over and nothing ever changes (even when we have spoke up about it) then sometimes its better to move on. I decided to pursue other ventures. Leaving that company was the biggest weight off of my shoulders ever. I hope that things have gotten better since then.",2021-02-02, Recruiter II

Some of the benefits are ok.","Wells Fargo is flailing trying to stay afloat. It is now trying everything it can to get rid of as many US employees in technology as possible and replace them with offshore employees at a fraction of the cost. The pandemic has only made this trend worse.

The experiment started about 7 years ago. Two separate management chains, which only diverge about a level or two below the CEO. Offshore is completely unaccountable to anyone in the US, and their performance is abysmal. US employees take the blame for their mistakes and often have to work extra to fix them.

Wells has always had a bad time managing underperforming employees. Employees who routinely do the jobs of 3 or more people are never promoted or given raises, while those who do nothing climb the ladder quickly. With offshore, that is magnified 10 times. Most offshore managers only care to increase their headcounts, with no regard for actual delivery of work. The project I work on has steadily collapsed under their weight, as every US employee who leaves is replaced by 3 offshore employees who do literally nothing, if you are lucky. I have ""coworkers"" who haven't made a single check-in in over 3 years. They are being promoted.

What we are now seeing is most of the valuable US employees being given negative performance reviews, including those who have literally done the work of 7 people for more than 5 years. Management does not care. They have targets to meet, and they will meet them.

It is abundantly clear the Wells Fargo is moving to a 100% offshore technology model at the expense of its US employees. We get no bonuses. We get no new hires. They get tons of bonuses for no work, and always seem to have new job reqs opening.

6036,3.0,"Former Employee, more than 10 years",It was a fun ride while it lasted,"The 10+ years at Wells Fargo have been both kind and unkind. Below are the things I enjoyed most.
The work is (mostly) meaningful, and sometimes treated as professionals by management. The people are technically savvy (some even smarter than myself, LOL) and really great to work with. I got along really well with most others, as long as we all focused on the premise that we are working for the same employer trying to accomplish roughly the same goal: building a better Wells Fargo one day at a time and one person at a time.
The pay is really good. Healthcare and related benefits are decent, but could be better. Paid holidays and PTO are satisfactory. Increasing PTO is a good way to keep employees. 401k matching to 6 percent is a gift, as was the ability to obtain an internal loan from the 401k balance was a lifesaver. 
The corporate cell phone and other technical equipment made the work more bearable. Although some years were considered ""tight"" and expenses were minimized or eliminated, having a corporate cell phone to separate personal and business calls makes all the difference. Also, having an option for a MacBook was much better than not allowing them at all (Thank you for merging with Wachovia Bank), and also allowed me to perform calculations and programming much better than the Windows laptops.
I enjoyed the 16 hours paid volunteer time, as well as matched donations to non-profits. Wells Fargo did a great job encouraging volunteerism and giving back to communities.","As someone with ""disabilities"", there were little accommodations that actually helped me feel like I was being heard, understood, and accepted by my immediate management. Instead, I was treated like a child until I raised my performance level, and was micro-managed for over a year, until laid off in December, 2020.
New upper management have raised several concerns and started workstreams/workgroups that will hopefully add some light at the end of the tunnel, however, it is a little too late for abuses that have already occurred and mindsets already set in stone. Despite the major abuses already discovered (2015 customer account abuses and subsequent regulation changes, 2009 Network Engineer burnout lawsuit, others), similar abuses still continue today due to the legacy Wells Fargo mindset to force employees to work until they burnout and leave, or are displaced at or above age 50. There are a few good managers, and most of the employees are awesome to work with, however, many have left or been pushed out due to lack of following with the marching orders.
There are no real career paths laid out, unless you want to become a political manager and move up the management chain of command. I and many others have suffered under this regime, and I have had little to no ability to move into the career path I really wanted. There was no time because I gave all of my energy and time to my day job, I was not given the opportunity to learn skills to move into the career I wanted to (no solid training courses or programs), and again, no tangible support from managers to help employees to grow.
Some of the new strategies from executive management are good, but several do not make sense for a majority of the technical staff, such as the migration to BYOD. Such strategies make sense for securing Wells Fargo assets, however, leave the employees out to fend for themselves. What about employees who cannot afford the necessary technology to perform their job? What about employees with little knowledge or ability to secure their home network?
Corporate technology that was paid for by Wells Fargo is increasingly watched and bogged down with security software to restrict and log every possible function, even if it is required by the job function or duties. Even my assigned MacBook Pro would turn the fan up and max out on resources on its own, or even crash the OS with no answers for many months.",2021-01-02, Information Security Engineer

6583,3.0,"Current Employee, more than 5 years","Relaxed environment, independence","Wells Fargo Home Mortgage (WFHM) is a great place to work for individuals with a background in mortgage and real-estate (such as appraisal, lending & underwriting, debt-collection, customer service, and business analysis), but it is heavily dominated by the paraprofessional class (i.e., those who majored in degrees that have nothing to do with banking or finance). In that sense it provides an excellent opportunity for those who have not had much luck finding work in their respective majors.

The Good: 

Wells Fargo provides great benefits for permanent employees and career-advancement for those who are dedicated and driven. WFHM in particular provides a relaxed environment to its employees and offers a great deal of independence (not a whole lot of micromanagement) in addition to sparing you from a lot of unnecessary hype, such as morale-boosting exercises and/or meetings.

In addition, virtually any mortgage experience on your resume carries some value in credentialing you for other mortgage careers.",One mark against WFHM is that makes heavy use of temporary/contracted workers and does not guarantee that such positions will end in permanent employment. This means that you could theoretically work an enjoyable position for years only to find yourself jobless the next. Wells Fargo also has a 6-month obligatory waiting period in between contracts so you aren't likely to return to your old position after having been let go.,2020-11-26, Loan Documentation Specialist IV

Luckily for me I was able to pass them, if you fail any of these tests you will be let go from your contract. Once passing all the tests you will be interviewed for the role. The job is pretty much guaranteed at this point since they spent the money getting you licensed for the role. As most of you know already, these particular licenses enable you to provide financial advice regarding investments such as Mutual Funds. However, in this specific role youâre unable to give any advice. There are 3 products you get to discuss with customers which would be a Wells Trade Account, Intuitive investor, or offering a phone based or full service FA. The customer has to decide which of these options is best for them. As the licensed associate youâre not able to tell them what would be best, oftentimes this creates an awkward experience between you and the customer because theyâre looking at you to be the expert and know what would be best suited for them. The role is basic and becomes mundane fast. 

Expect to be taking back to back calls for your entire shift. 
Expect to repeat disclosures on every call. 
Expect your calls to be reviewed constantly and brought to your attention if you failed to state verbatim one of the 5+ disclosures. 
Expect to work Saturdays if youâre new. 
Expect to be in the role for a very long time, I was in the role for 2 years. I was constantly looking to get into an analytical role. Despite being in the role 2 years I was unable to interview for any other position I applied for internally. As for my colleagues they experienced the same problems regarding internal promotions. 
Expect your manager to miss all your 1 on 1 meetings. 
Expect to be a number and a droid. 
Expect upset customers, as most customers resent WFA for the scandals and disorganized client services group. 
Expect to regret the job you have chosen. 

On the final note I wanted to share the moment I was working Saturday in March 2020, when the COVID pandemic was on the rise and a stay at home order was issued by the NC governor. During work on Saturday a gentlemen in a hazmat suit showed up at my desk, informing me they would be spraying because someone in a nearby cubicle had been quarantined for being in close contact with someone who had COVID. My colleague and I, who were the only 2 scheduled at the Charlotte site on that particular Saturday were flabbergasted to say the least. My lazy employer failed to mention to us they were spraying the building that day for COVID. My manager asked me for a picture of the gentleman in the hazmat suit, I took the photo on my cellphone sent it to my boss. He told us to leave immediately and that we would be compensated for a full day of work. Later my boss calls my personal cell on my time to tell me the photos I have taken were illegally obtained, since I took the photos on private property. He asked me to delete the photos and call any of my family members I sent them to, so they could also delete them from their phones. Unbelievable, right?

My department has been transitioned to 2 other departments since starting. This means Iâve had 3 roles since I started, which is incredibly unorthodox I believe, but I do understand Covid made somethings different. It wouldnât be a big deal except every time Iâve been âtrainedâ for my roles with WF, there has been almost ZERO training.  Even my manager doesnât get trained or seem to know things. The job itself is fine, but talk about stress when youâre asked to do a job after literally 1-2 hrs of training and thrown new customers every day. I was in a call with my bosses, bosses, boss and when a question was presented with concerns about the constant transitions, they were told âHLPâs are here to execute leaderships goals, thatâs the end of it.â After hearing that response, Iâve never, ever felt so much like a number and my opinion as employee is not cared for. I definitely have learned that if you work at Wells Fargo you do not get to express ANY concerns and if you do management makes you feel like youâre in the wrong for bringing it up. 

When it comes to the work itself, not anyone else seems to care about helping the customers than The HLP and HMC, who are bound to the underwriters schedule to look at anything. Customers are always disappointed in WF lack of concern on purchases/refinances. 

Also, there isnât really any additional benefit given to employees who get Covid other than STD. Many other companies allowed you to take time off or made schedule adjustments for those with children related to Covid issues, but  not WF.",2020-12-02, Home Loan Processor

Decent PTO and holidays. Management generally let's you work flex time - I am not a morning person and generally didn't get to work before 9am. My manager never gave me a hard time about it as long as I got 40 hours in. Bonus was about 10% of my base as long as quality was good. Also I felt that quality control was generally pretty fair in their reviews, although others disagree with me on that. Overall I was appreciative to have this job.","Not able to get your DE unless you worked in a particular physical office in 2 states only; lots of regulation impact on employees - such as, not allowed to use excel (seriously, and if you were caught using excel worksheets you were in trouble), random mid-year in-person interviews by internal auditors; training was rough - not enough access to help when needed and the corporate trainor didn't even know how to use the lending software - sent us back totally unprepared ; they use a program called ""core"" for underwriting and it is glitchy (for example, when the last condition is cleared the loan will automatically CTC itself. So let's say you cleared all uw conditions, but the title and appraisal were not in file yet. Those come in later and get cleared by the collateral review team. Without any warning, your loan issues it's own clear to close status. This causes you to miss anything new added to the loan before the loan gets audited by QC. Also, once a loan is in CTC status it can never be moved back. So if the loan suddenly isn't ctc anymore (let's say documents expired), it will stay in CTC status, making it hard to manage your pipeline/be aware of the true status of a loan.  Also- the system ""recommends"" a document to be attached to a condition and people overseas will attach conditions at 2am. (Processors don't really process here, they just resubmit loans when they see that the system recommended a document to a condition). No control at all over what processors do. Underwriter essentially becomes the processor much of the time. Finally, exceptions to credit policy were painstaking to request. Long turn time to get a reply and the system would lock you from making any changes, including canceling the request! This was very annoying.",2020-10-01, Mortgage Underwriter

Micro management from Regional level to the point of what amounts to an unnecessary, unethical and unprofessional behind your back approach to inspect by asking direct reports about their leadership, which in turn, tears down a Managers ability to build a team, a business, or hold a team accountable towards the right behaviors. An approach that compromises Branch Management as well as overall Team cohesion. This is done, in experience, due to personal insecurities or vendetta of an unqualified Regional Manager, not based in business need or fact .
Any successful organization will tell you that once talent is brought on, allow that Leader to work, to bring his/her respective skills set experience and value to the table, instead of breaking them down and (attempt to) churn them out, be it by burnout or under some false guise. Again, in my experience and conversation with others, former and current, this is due to personal insecurities, nepotism, and/or to place fear in others so that they may be controlled.

my biggest pro was that the location I worked at was extremely convenient for me

They mask it all very well by providing every employee with bogus corporate training and videos that make you believe you're in a safe work environment but you're not. They try to give you the time to take them all but no one ever does because they'd rather use that time to do other activities that help them either keep their job or keep from getting written up. The way they approach development and issues with your work is patronizing. Every meeting is just a series of questions that lead to another question that eventually lead to an explanation of how you're incompetent as an employee. They didn't say it, you say it, so its an HR friendly of telling you you suck, work harder. When you do get something right they pat you on the back and say nice but how come you didn't do this ALSO. The fear of lower level employees drives the lowkey intimidation all of management know they have. Everyone is SCARED to speak up in fear of retaliation. Then the company falls back on the most bogus no retaliation policy that comes way of those useless trainings and videos I mentioned before. So you speak up on the fact retaliation is still happening despite the policy and then the company hides behind an HR department that's suppose to protect you. HR is an absolute joke. Opened several claims to HR even in groups involving half the team members to no avail. Every answer back from them was a professional and corporate friendly way of saying, ""we understand and empathize with your problem but we don't agree, deal with it."" or ""we understand we're going to talk to upper management"" then upper management sides with the people you have a problem with because they're buddies. 

Ridiculous work expectations and performance that's globally expected due to the intimidation factor and complete lack of confidence and support. You will feel overworked and absolutely dread or fear coming to work 

Don't make any last minute or even 1-2 week plans in advance you have to ask for vacation 4 weeks in advance and still hope it doesn't interfere with anyone else's schedule

Sunday off but 2nd day off is completely random 

Don't even get me started on the WORST commission structure of all time. especially now that they're apologizing for opening fake accounts. And whatever commission you make gets paid 3 months later, what a joke. 

Lastly depending on your location a certain ethnic group will most likely dominate the work place even up to higher management so you'll experience racism/favoritism to some guaranteed degree if you're not part of that group. But remember they'll mask that too and keep it under wraps with those same bogus policies and a PHENOMENAL HR team. Sarcasm implied*",2020-10-05, Personal Banker II

-They still have traditional bank services and features like actual tellers with the option of digital for customers based on preferences.
-Changes are made off of customer and team member feedback vs. company goals. 
-You are able to be the best version of yourself as Wells Fargo allows diversity in backgrounds,thoughts, and ideas which supports our diverse customer base.
-If you consistently work hard, you will be noticed and rewarded no matter how incompetent your manager is!
-Benefits are good, and there are many options available.  New team members start with 12 or 13 days of PTO, 2 personal holidays, and 2 community service days in addition to regular bank holidays.
-The top priority managers teach their team is to focus on the customers need through understanding whatâs most important to them and not the bank.","-Middle management is a joke and half.  My District Manager stays at home 4/5 days a week and managed by emailing reports. I think I may see them once every other month which is not supportive of my career development. Unfortunately, this a trend from market to market. Iâm not sure what happens when someone becomes a DM... someone need to look at that.
-As a Branch Manager, it can be difficult to complete your responsibilities due to staffing issues that never end. Itâs hard to be upset, because most of them move to different areas or get promoted. Itâs just really hard to get a posting for a new position. 
-Our teller and banker systems are outdated. They have errors and delay customer interactions on a daily basis.
-There is no sales incentive for doing well. More times than not, a branch that has large volumes of customer traffic will always receive higher payout than smaller branches.  The customers literally come to those branches to apply for accounts. They way the incentive is made, branch balance totals are adjusted so frequently that you never understand if your branch is actually growing!  This makes it difficult for a manager to motivate their team to exceed customer expectations each day. I see where theyâre coming from.. why work harder when theyâre going to pay you incentive for just coming to work LOL.
-The pay structure is silly. Like May companies, they make salary decisions based on how easy or difficult is will be to retain you.  So if I live in an area with less jobs equal to mine at other companies, they have a lower risk of me leaving and pay me less. If I live in an area with a lot of competition for my skills, they pay more. This causes team members to get paid less for the same job someone is doing in another area regardless of their work ethic. Raises? 1% if you perform, 2% if you exceed, 3% if you do some type of sexual favor for your boss if you can find them after they give you keys to the branch. Iâm kidding about the 3%. Thatâs too generous for them. 
-The training has become the worst Iâve ever seen at a company of this size. When I first began in 2012, they taught more in-depth material that allowed you to come into the branch with a basic idea of what youâre doing. Now, my team members come in the branch with two weeks of questions to ask. Unfortunately, the manager has to then choose to do their tasks or support the team member by actually training them. Of course I choose my team members development which leads to extra hours in the Branch for myself after close for everything else. 
-I feel appreciated by upper management, but itâs lip service most of the time. I think they expect my direct manager to do the leg work to make me feel valued and thatâs missing completely. After numerous positive customer reviews, the recognition I receive is only based on me teaching other people how to achieve the same business results. Can I at least get a breakfast muffin? Or even an empty bag with an imaginary muffin? Ok, well letâs start with a thank you and go from there  :)
-Geez look at the time - by now you may be thinking Iâm a disgruntled employee, but Iâm not. I just feel the bank could support areas better than they are and meet the commitments they strive to meet with their team members like they attempt to do with customers.",2020-07-16, Branch Manager

- Work/life balance is excellent - laptops are closed by 5pm at the latest (only rarely are there extraordinary needs that require after hours work)
- Incredibly diverse team, lots of women in leadership roles (at our level, anyway, not so much 'upstairs')","- Upper management is still resistant to approving full-time Work From Home, even with Covid-19 and a CEO who is remote from NY. Some folks are not being approved for FT WFH, even for jobs that have been done remotely for years now. 
- Conflict-avoidant culture... As reported in the press, serious problems and bad behavior still not directly addressed and allowed to go on for too long.
- Old, institutionalized, dinosaur mentality (mostly 'upstairs') and fear of change. Lots of old white guys in charge, so... yeah.
- Under-performers and folks who just won't do their jobs can easily hide, the org is so large. And because conflict avoidant, these problem folks are never dealt with.
- Salaries are below market for design jobs. Raises don't keep up with inflation.
- The process to get any little thing done is arduous and time intensive. There are so many groups and systems involved, it's redonkulous.",2020-06-03, Senior Content Strategist

8192,1.0,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",CRE Relationship Manager,You will get experience at a large organization that works with some large clients,"Th he organization has a large number of problems that make it impossible to do your job and enjoy being at Wells. They are as follows:

1. Management: The people in charge have created such a toxic culture that anyone you would want to work under or with leaves within 1-2 years. Many senior RM staff are simply there because they cannot find another job and will make your life very difficult. Throwing underlings under the bus is a regular occurrence and promotion is based on politics and desperation to get someone to stay that has told management they are leaving. 

2: Career Development: There is none unless you are extremely lucky. Trying to move to different groups will often not be allowed and management can deny your transfer for any reason. After this you will be marked as not âloyalâ and you essentially have no future. Few, if any of the things you will do will be transferable to real finance jobs so your time in the position will be viewed by other employers as little better then unemployment. Trying to better yourself through school or programs such as the CFA or CAIA is highly discouraged and can lead to outright retaliation in some cases. 

Pay: You will be paid 25-40% less then the same job at other banks and will be paid 30-50% less then what you would make on the principal side in a finance position. Bonuses are reserved for those that feed managements ego so expect to make only 10-25% of your bonus potential no matter how well you preform.",2020-07-01, CRE Relationship Manager

-Flexible hours (could work 9-5, or work a 4-10 schedule)
-Managers expected results but treated us like human beings
-Work culture was fairly balanced
-Managers were transparent in departments goals and expectations, which made it easier for us to work and obtain (we consistently met 97% SLA monthly all over the country).
-Entry level pay was fairly competitive

When I left:
-Team came together, but it was due to us relying on each other to get through the day.","By the time I left:
-They laid off our sister site with little warning, despite our departments doing very well
-They strung contractors along for well over two years before they got frustrated and left; they were dedicated and reliable workers, and new contractors were a mixed bag.
-In my last year, we changed over multiple managers; I believe our immediate manager tried to shield us from a lot of things, but upper management pressed hard, which trickled down to the Processors
-Micro-managing. We were only allowed seven minutes the entire day to use the restroom. As the bathrooms were on the other side of the floor, one visit took 3 1/2 minutes, running. 
-Work environment became toxic, and by the time I left, the turnover rate had been rising.
-Managers no longer were transparent; goals changed frequently without warning, and upper management became obviously disdainful of the Processors when we didn't meet 100% SLA (our team worked with appraisers all over the country, and most of the time if a report didn't come in on time, it meant the appraiser had trouble or just didn't bother doing the report).

Then when management didn't like what we did, we would get chastised for it and penalized. There were constant threats and intimidation tactics used, and unrealistic weekly deadlines. There were also threats of senior management taking away the work-from-home flexibility, even though it worked very well for most of us. Most of us were working a lot of unpaid overtime, and there was no flexibility in our work hours, even though we did not work with the general public.

Countless certification classes have to be taken, and I mean countless!  Most have nothing to do with your job.  They are long and mind-numbing.

Apparently WF tellers have to be told how to be ethical...sad.  Perhaps HR should do their job.

Speaking of HR, I donât know if we even have an HR department.  Well, unless you count the Diversity personnel.  What do they do exactly????

Donât expect anyone to be helpful.

Donât expect documentation.

Donât expect training.

Expect a lot of temps...I mean contractors.  And donât expect them to have good hygiene.  I would be shocked if one of them washed their hands in the restroom.

Expect every IT request to take forever and donât expect it to be easy.  

Very old school mentality.  People cling to the past and fear job security.

If you have the misfortune of working in IT...youâll know what Iâm talking about.  The Operations Center takes business casual to a whole new level.  I didnât realize stained sweatpants were business casual.

And they will tell you to do things you know are wrong when you get into production so you can try to reach their insane goals.  Probably why they have so many lawsuits all the time. They will tell you there is a bonus structure and then do everything they can to make sure no one can reach their goals to get the bonus, which is why their employees ste worked to death and constantly stressed to their max. Room for advancement is limited and managers can block you from applying to different departments for ANY reason. Really.  ANY reason.

The CEO is doing his best cleaning up the mess from past events and has a good reputation in the industry.","Cons greatly outweigh the Pros as you can see from the upcoming rant.

Benefits aren't that great. Still have to pay for the high deductible plan and contribute to an HSA. The deductible is also much higher than what I used to have elsewhere.

Constant reorgs. I accepted an offer, then about a week before my start date the team I joined was put under a different group of which the Manager has no idea why the team is reporting to him! I have not worked on a single thing since I was hired... NOT A SINGLE THING. The reorg has nothing to do with it though, the project pipeline has no future insight. They work on a single project until it is done and THEN decide what the next project is.

SLOW!!!! The team I joined says they've been working on the same project for 3+ years! Everyone that works here seems to be stuck in their old ways, they aren't open to adopt anything new. Skype Audio Meetings are literally just becoming a thing here and no one seems to want to adopt it for some reason, this is a decent example of how far behind they are in terms of using modern technology. They would rather dial in from a VIOP phone AND join a Skype Meeting to view what someone is presenting. Makes no sense to me why no one wants to add audio to the Skype Meeting, it's simple. I'm mind blown by this.

TONS of restrictions. I understand with it being a bank and all, but software that you can install on your system is very limited, no modern technology, all old legacy stuff. You'd think modern tech would have better security vs legacy. Hard to research and learn a topic or simply find a solution to a problem since almost every single site is blocked (except for StackOverflow THANK GOD).

I left a job where I was valued (but underpaid) and worked with tons of other smart engineers for this. Thought I was coming in to be in more of a Lead role and was more motivated than ever. Now I am demotivated, twirling my thumbs everyday trying to keep myself busy....

On the plus side, it's Monday thru Friday, a regular schedule, a full if pricey cafeteria, lovely grounds to walk around on your lunch break, and fairly good security. Some teams are much better than others.","Wells Fargo at this call center only hires new CSRs through employment agencies, so if you accept this position be prepared to make $13.50 to $14.00 an hour for the same work that your ""official"" Wells Fargo employed team members are making $19 to $25 an hour to do. If anything, you will work harder, because all the calls not requiring ""special handling"" will get routed to you. You will take back to back calls all day every day, while your team members chat about their lives and weekend plans. And I know, ""I get paid either way"", but sure not paid enough.
We are promised a good chance of being ""hired on"" after a certain amount of time and proving ourselves as valuable employees, and finally attaining the job security, pay increase, PTO, vacation days, sick time, and stock options, but believe me, it's just a carrot on a stick held in front of you to make you give maximum effort for minimum compensation.
Why are they paying agencies big money to bring us in, full background checks, FBI fingerprinting, eight weeks of paid training, and then hiring only one agency person on in the past 6 months? Because there is a possibility this site may shut down in the next year or two, and all agency employees aren't going to need that severance package, right?
And good attendance, people skills, and work ethic won't get you hired as an official employee, you have to market Wells Fargo products. ""It's not selling stuff, it's 'having a conversation' "". OK. After the Wells Fargo scandals over marketing products, (Google it if you don't know, I had to) you would not think you'd have to sell stuff to people who call in with concerns about keeping their homes to get hired here, but you do. If someone calls in looking to refinance, sure, but if someone calls in and immediately launches in to ""why weren't my taxes paid out of my escrow?!?!"", and there's a note on their account to try to sell them another mortgage, it is held against you if you don't do it! The survey system is ridiculous, their opinion of your service is lumped right in with how the customer perceives Well Fargo. The American people don't trust or respect Wells Fargo, and you are not paid enough to try to make the overpaid bosses look good. As an agency employee, you will be treated differently, all my fellow agency employees will back me up on this. Left out of team potlucks, generally left to our own devices to figure stuff out, reminded snidely to ""call Robert Half, or Dysis, or Sparks"" or whoever your employment agency is, if a customer recommends in a review that you get a raise or a compliment. If you think your agency pay is in anyway compensation for what you'll be doing, think again. If you think you're so awesome you'll be hired on within a year, think again.",2020-02-14, CSR2

They are rated by reviews and putting the customer first. It is a very customer sentric company now. In the retirement center they were fantastic, understanding of any learning curve new associates have. You are helped by teammates as well as management. The amount of time my manager spent with me was shocking compared to other companies. You actually looked forward to them stopping by instead of dreading it. You are not yelled at for a mistake at all. I Love this company. I only left because my boyfriends father got leukemia in Arizona. I can reapply and come back, but I am moving.

Their benefits are spectacular. in addition to your PTO they also provide you with 2 additional days to use on personal holidays for those of us that celebrate other holidays, you also get 2 more days to use for volunteering (can even be to supervise a school trip with your kid!).

Here is my breakdown on why the contract to hire model is a very very poor tool for Wells Fargo. 

1) Most Staffing agencies will ignore your resume or not work with you because that is considered poaching

2) Those same staffing companies will in turn hire outside talent that are generally not familiar with Wells Fargo software, policies, or have experience.

For two weeks you were trained then thrown on the phone with those new set of skills with the SAME SALARY. That was crazy to me. I had to spend longer times on the phone for I was doing more trying to troubleshoot for customers and was making the same amount of money before learning the skills. That's terrible. They don't listen or care about their employees. They will bribe you with food if their surveys are low or you seem unsatisfied. I also do believe Wells Fargo is related with money laundering for sure and they foster an environment for their customers that enable them to stay poor.

-Decent pay
-Benefits like 401k and paid volunteer time
-You might get one of the few good managers they have","-Ridiculous metrics, especially Average Handle Time. They care more about you having quick calls than actually solving the customers' problems. They tell you in training don't worry about AHT because the customer experience is more important. But once you get out of training, if your AHT is high, which is normal, you will constantly get nagged over it and micromanaged. AHT is probably the most important metric to them because they say the company spends millions of dollars in operation costs every second you're on the phone. But if you don't completely solve the customer's probably they'll have to call back and take up more time. I've had managers give us tips for how to get customers off the phone before they bring up another thing they need help with so that you can meet the AHT metric. Bad business practice.
-They sell you on the bonus you could get based on customer experience surveys. But even if you do really well in that, you won't get it even if your AHT is a couple seconds too high or if you had a QA dock and you're even a point off the requirement. But the rest of your team will still get a bonus based on the team's customer survey scores including your scores in the average.
-Even if you get a high score in your schedule adherence, your ability to solve the customer's problem on the first call, high customer scores, high quality assurance scores, etc, if your AHT isn't perfect even if you've brought it down, you won't get any reward and very little recognition.
-You get some good customers but you'll get a lot who scream at you, cuss at you, personally insult you and your intelligence, etc. and the company does little to prevent these types of customers from calling in and treating team members that way.
-There's very little flexibility to actually help customers and I agree some policies aren't fair to them. Those are tough calls to take and you get them a lot.
-No time to breath with maximum nine seconds between calls. Back to back for 8-10 hours. If you get up to use the bathroom outside of breaks it affects your schedule adherence. Every second of your time is micromanaged and you start to feel like a child and it's hard to regroup after a call.
-Too many coachings. At least once a week, but can be multiple times a week. They  will also plug in and listen to your calls while you take them to coach you, which is very stressful and inefficient. The occasional coaching and performance review is good. But too often starts to feel overwhelming and like a punishment. I don't know any adults at their job who are coached that often.
-Sometimes you will get a cool manager. Sometimes you will get one who micromanages worse than most and tracks you down to remind you to go to a meeting instead of trusting you to be an adult and check your own schedule. They will make you fill out unnecessary forms about your calls as you go through them. The will move you around on teams so if you get a good manager, don't get too comfortable.
-If you go to a manager needing help for something with benefits, leaves, your schedule, etc, they will either give you incorrect info because they don't know much. Or they won't help you at all and claim there's nothing they can do for you when they can.
-We once had a meeting with our manager's boss to give anonymous feedback. Beforehand said manager complained about anonymous feedback he was given previously. After the meeting, he talked to each employee individually and reworded the comments as questions to figure out who said what.
-If you have advice for how something can be done better or how they can help you to do your job better, they won't listen to it because they ""have to"" do things the way they are
-This job will ruin your mental health and make you anxious and drained all the time. You learn that rude customers aren't making it personal, but hours of that a day still drains you and makes it hard to focus. This makes the pay not even worth it between that and the micromanaging.",2019-09-09, Phone Banker

Work life balance is a joke, and this is not a good fit for working parents. Youâre pressured into working overtime every week.

It should be noted that these points apply to Anti-Money Laundering only.

Management has been moving forward with a plan, despite widespread criticism at the investigator level, to move all teams to a 5 days in office/5 days working from home plan.  This plan would be so rigid as to force you to use your own PTO if you were unable to be in the office or work from home on your assigned week.  Our team has repeatedly been misled, beginning with our initial interviews, on the leniency of the company's work from home policy.  As our team has bounced between leaders, each has arbitrarily raised the required minimum days remaining on cases in our queue to prevent us from working remotely.  Leadership has also repeatedly dangled the prospect of across the board promotions to all Financial Crimes Consultant 2 team members to FC 3, however, as this has been in talks for over a year, and we are in yet another hiring freeze, this appears to be just another tall tale.  

There appears to be little to no room for advancement in Philadelphia, as financial crimes compliance is frequently subject to hiring freezes, and they appear to be pushing to remove us physically from the building based on the above working from home plan.

This theme of arbitrary leadership decisions is a problem across all aspects of our work, and is exacerbated by the clear lack of industry knowledge and proper priorities for compliance investigations groups at all levels of management on the East Coast, but particularly at the manager and director level.  Wells Fargo's program requires each and every case to be scrutinized by your direct manager, who often apply their own questionable nitpicks to what should be a streamlined, consistent production-based environment.  Some managers have next to no financial crimes experience, knowledge of company systems, or leadership skills.  If you are used to any autonomy in your investigative work, you will hate it here.  This is the only investigative group I've been a part of where the managers have no cases of their own to complete, and are essentially QR (even though there is an actual QR with much more lenient standards as they service all teams). 

These huge inconsistencies between teams are the result of an overall lack of written policies and procedures I had never encountered in a compliance program before coming to Wells Fargo.  What little written guidance there is is often supplemented by verbal updates from leadership with questionable understanding of the issues at hand, and often are never even added in writing to the compliance manuals.  Teams with the same pay grade, investigative mandates, and case loads are hugely inconsistent across the company to a level I had not though imaginable.  This can mean the difference between one team only having to review a single account for a month time span, with another team for the same referral having to review 20 accounts over a year.  There appears to be an established culture of managers and directors with no real productive casework to do, who are encouraged to add their own anal guidelines for their respective teams down the chain.  Every single policy change I have seen, at the director or manager level, has consisted of them adding more work for us to do, or curtailing our privileges.  It is especially insulting having compliance experience in mature programs and knowing that these changes are never actually the result of guidance stemming from the federal government or an audit, but middle managers seeking to appear more strict and thorough than the next, as they view our teams as another stepping stone to move up.

Philadelphia morale remains low as our teams are again and again subject to rules which we see our colleagues in other regions, lucky enough to be under qualified leadership, not have to deal with.  Management holds us to the quantitative standards of a high volume production environment, and appears unable to create efficient processes to succeed with that level of case work.  Our case load has increased unbelievably in our time, from what was an expected 3 cases completed per day, to what is now 5.  It is impossible to conduct in depth reviews given that volume yet managers constantly push for more to be completed.  We feel that we are always bearing the burden of management's lack of planning which caused this situation, as we are constantly understaffed, and see arbitrary priority level escalations, new monitoring referral sources, and ill-conceived policies be implemented every day.",2019-06-14, Financial Crimes Consultant AML
