*Have to work the sort a full year before applying to any RTD driver position and after you get a hernia lifting that 140lb BBQ grill you won't want to work here anymore, not even in RTD.

*Seniority system allows inexperienced new RTD drivers to be promoted over experienced proven long term drivers by seniority which is unsafe, hence all the accidents by newbies. seniority doesn't trump experience when driving a 80,000lb 53 ft semi truck but in this critical position they choose to be unsafe.

*OT sign up is by seniority and rotated so your selected once every 4-5 weeks for additional 4-5 hrs of OT.

*Part timers only get half the pay/ benefits as FTer's yet have to pay same amount for insurance and if you want additional coverage ADD+life etc. plan on losing a full paycheck per month to pay your insurance.

* If you have a family, a spouse, mortgage/rent/bills to pay stay away from FedEx Express, 20-25 hrs a week get you nowhere in the real world and when your kids say after church ""daddy can we eat out today"" the only place you can go is to McDonald's for a $1 spicy chicken sandwich cuz you'll be broke after you pay the rent/bills.

Good benefits - cheap-ish insurance and they are transitioning from providing a pension to an increased 401k contribution for new employees. You put in 6%, they put in 8% instead of the old 3.5% match.

I see both of those as pros, lol.","Consistent re-orgs and old-head buyouts have shifted the employees that were experts in their area out of those roles and the problems that's caused throughout the company is immeasurable - this made a lot of jobs harder and less organized.

The benefits and perks are some of the best I've had, but if I'm being honest should be expected from a company of this size. (500,000+ employees)

Formed a lot of great relationships, not only with my FedEx peers, but also my customer base.","Dated and antiquated technologies, too many redundant mandatory meetings that conflict with valuable selling time. Management is very hands off when you need them for anything, but are quick to spot and point out deficiencies in your work when it's time for evals.

With inside sales we're expected to call on the same leads in our small book of business to somehow regularly uncover new business, we call cycle them over and over again until we do which creates a borderline call center environment. As you begin to saturate your territory with your presence and build relationships over the course of your tenure this becomes increasingly difficult and unrealistic to sustain as there's only so much potential to work with once you start gaining momentum and winning key accounts, especially if your territory alignment doesn't change much.

Being hourly employees there's not enough time in the day to complete the tasks we're graded on and anything done outside of logged calls and e-mails isn't considered actual 'work' in the eyes of leadership which leads to a stressful and overwhelming race to satisfy a call count before you have to call it a day. It's as if the people that provide directive have never worked a day in the job to understand what we actually deal with.

Meanwhile on a daily basis we're expected to plan for the next day, do market research on our customers/industries, submit collaborative cases with other internal channels, find time to conduct business reviews, create pricing presentations, work with pricing analysts to maintain P/L and last but not least one of the main things that plagues this role that leadership turns a blind eye to‚Äî picking up the pieces when other OpCo's within FedEx fall short. From customer service issues, operations, billing/revenue, the list goes on. The support tools we're told to leverage for these daily occurrences are nowhere near effective which usually results in more lost time and frustration when all we want to do is support and advocate for our businesses and sell!

When concerns are brought up on metrics and corrupt selling time it's a lot of ""back in my day!"" talk which is typical sales deflection. Most of these comments made by Directors/VP's who sold 15-20 years ago during simpler times, back when there was far less competition like Amazon and other large players to contend with. Customers also weren't as educated and equipped with innovation at their fingertips like now.

Your experience will vary and is heavily dictated by which state your territory is in, what type of industry/market you serve and so many other variables outside of your control.

The growth path is also too linear, the only way to move up is to actually MOVE, as in to another state to show FedEx how much you're willing to sacrifice for the company. All for a marginal salary increase and basically keeping the same title. Kiss it goodbye if you're trying to advance in your domicile location because people rarely resign from these positions if you're in a major market so you are forced to make the move if you want to advance. If you cannot do that you've essentially bottlenecked in this role.

This job has evolved to become a revolving door with the recent changes, you better move quick or it'll eventually hit you on your way out. All this is coming from a former employee that has met and exceeded plan during my entire tenure falling in the top 5-10 of my region with numbers and compensation to back it.","Mar 15, 2021 ", Business Sales Account Executive

For low-level business sales, the hourly pay rate (about $23/hour) is actually livable. It's not a comfortable living, but you can pay your bills on the base pay, which is nice.

If you want a career in sales and are willing to move, this is a good starting point. Most inside sales reps can promote to field sales in a different city after 15 months, and the pay starts to get more comfortable at that level.

If you enjoy fast-paced, relentless sales, you'll like the job.

Once global travel resumes, you do get to fly standby at decent prices.

When you clock off for the day, you're done. No overtime, no staying late... just carry the stress home with you and let it bubble overnight.","Career opportunities outside of sales are nearly nonexistent, despite what management will say in your interview. People can move out of sales if they're creative in finding ways to network, which management in the sales office will not be very helpful with.
The path to move up is through field sales. If you're unable to move, or don't want to stay in sales, the best of luck to you.

While the hourly pay is livable, you're unlikely to receive the bonus checks you hear about in the offer letter. 80% of the Dallas office does not bonus for the quarter. It's not a question of work ethic. FedEx is struggling as a company, and it's a very difficult market to be competitive in. Whether or not your territory has potential is luck of the draw.

Since FedEx is doing so poorly right now globally, upper management has put all of its efforts into straining the sales team to do more, constantly. The difficulty of this is exacerbated by the antiquated internal systems that take minutes to hours to struggle through for things like pricing proposals.

The number of sales calls you're expected to make continues to grow to ever more unrealistic levels. While it's possible to make all the calls, emails, and sales opportunities that are expected of you each day, it's unsustainable. I've cycled through my list of customers, some more than once over, in the last month because I'm constantly trying to reach the daily call metric.

If dialing the phone were your only responsibility, it might make sense, but you're also expected to draft pricing proposals and present them to close business. If you spend an hour researching and drafting pricing, and then you spend another hour presenting it, this counts as one sales call in your daily metrics.
According to management, at this point, you've had an extremely unproductive day with your one measly call. Whether or not your time is spent growing revenue is irrelevant.

With such an emphasis on arbitrary daily metrics, there isn't much opportunity to actually do the job you're hired to do, which would be closing business.
All this said, I haven't mentioned how much time it can take to help resolve customer issues. You're constantly told by management to let customer service handle complaints and issues- your job is to sell. Fair enough, but customer service seems to be trained to send customers to their account executive when they aren't sure how to handle something. 

This means that any time you spend not working toward your daily metrics counts as not working. If you're fixing something for a customer, working to create revenue for a company by making proposals, or doing something as important as assisting a teammate with a problem, you are wasting your time in the eyes of management.

There's not enough time in a work day, and there's not enough resources to do the job. All of the complaints I've listed have been discussed with varying levels of management, and are consistently discarded as a personal problem with time management.

TLDR: you're expected to constantly do more, your efforts are hardly appreciated, and when you try to make suggestions for improvement, you're ignored. You feel undervalued as a FedEx employee during these times. The company is struggling, and is trying to get every bit of mileage out of you it can.

I would only recommend this job to someone who lives and breathes selling. Otherwise, this job is not worth the stress.","May 12, 2020 ", Business Sales Inside Account Executive

With such a broad range of positions, it's easy to move between workgroups to continue learning and to avoid boredom in any single position.

As an enterprise, FedEx is supported by an outstanding corporate reputation and one of the strongest, most recognizable brands in the world. Our position at the crossroads of global commerce and transportation makes FedEx and its business performance a leading economic indicator. Led by our founder, chairman, president and CEO Fred Smith, our senior leadership is widely respected in the investment community for its conservative approach and its commitment to long-term growth.","With our roots and core businesses in air and ground transportation, FedEx and its business performance are highly vulnerable to fluctuations in oil and fuel costs. In periods of escalating energy prices, FedEx -- like many businesses -- must manage costs very carefully and adjust short- and long-term priorities accordingly. Although FedEx has long adhered to an unofficial ""no layoff"" policy, this often leads to the discontinuation of many projects in mid-stream.

While FedEx revenues are increasingly global, our core domestic express business has reached a plateau of maturity and is facing additional headwinds from the U.S. economy and a weaker U.S. dollar that limits demand for imports in the United States.","May 14, 2008 ", Senior Marketing Specialist

Corporate culture breeds pride in the company and most employees bleed purple for it.
Work/life balance.
Fairly stable job situation even when times are not so good.
Fred Smith founded the company and built everything from the ground up. This really means something, you have to find out for yourself.
Regardless of the downsides listed, this review is a definite net positive. I highly recommend FedEx as a good place to work.","Bonuses and other compensation lopsidedly favor the people on top.
Most of the management chain of command is often more focused on producing numbers and reports and looking good to the people above them.
In IT disagreement with directives from higher up are discouraged - people in such positions ""retire early"" or ""leave to pursue other opportunities""; this results in no negative feedback ever going up the chain for improvements and reduction of waste and overhead. Needless to say, everything that comes down from the CIO ""succeeds"".
The company relies heavily Fred Smith's [excellent] business sense & judgment. When he leaves, there are very, very few in this company's upper echelons that can replace him with any probability of success. The most likely scenario when he retires is a slow but inevitable downward spiral and FedEx will be another corporate machine run on numbers.

Overall, this company is not as friendly as the last corporation where I was employed - I think this has to do with the international flavor of FedEx versus the last corporation where I worked most of the people were from the Southern US.  It often takes a while to find out who the correct people are to be working with on any given project because the company is so gigantic and along with that comes an enormous amount of red tape from legal and those processes many times hold projects up for an unecessary amount of time.","May 15, 2008 ",

Great work/life balance (at least in my org).","The fact that it is such a great and stable company makes for some complacent employees in some cases, and some groups are quite insulated/resistant to change. Every group is different, but it's not uncommon to find a team that just cruises and doesn't really try to push the envelope (including managers). Additionally, size of organization makes for a lot of overhead when trying to institute any kind of change, as there are many disparate groups/processes that must align.

You must negotiate negotiate negotiate!  You also do not receive stock offering as with some other large companies. I have found that peers, some with less experience than myself, actually make a great deal more than me (10-20,000). Pay seems to be based on your ability to negotiate coming in the door and management's willingness to be fair. I don't want to say race/age plays much of a factor, but as with any large company there are some inequalities here as well. There is not much room to negotiate increases when promoted as there is a standard increase that is not based on performance.

This action is required because the firm has sophisticated financial modeling tools that rely on its incredibly huge data-base, which covers its customer's shipping habits, and the corresponding costs. One example: An Services Department employee needs to become pretty well schooled with SQL and other database management tools. FedEx offers a number of ""live"" training classes in addition to on-line-based coursework, which greatly helps the employee develop or fine-tune code-writing skills.","Required training session, either live or taught on-line, are often a big time-sink. This, particularly when the school session occurs during a workday. Project deadlines always loom, so the required training classwork... in a live classroom setting... can materially eat-away at a productive day. The on-line based training programs, particularly with database management, can be very arduous... the text-based product MUST BE VERY CLOSELY READ in order to move-up to the next module. A live training class would offer hands-on help quickly vs. a website-session that might require the student hours to catch-on to the same topic. However, the live classes are traditionally only during the workday.

2.

There is NEVER a reason for a marketing person to get a PMP certification....but they pretty much force you to do it.  

3. Once you become a manager, you are protected from any sort of criticism or feedback.  PULSE was a joke and they did away with it to where you couldn't even give management feedback.  They ended up watering it down to a ""general"" department talking session, which accomplishes nothing at all

The best time to apply for FedEx is right before holiday season; (I applied the last week of october and got my job on Halloween. ) although, holiday season has really high amounts of workload and you'll be forced to work extra hours at varying clock in/clock out times. You don't have a standard clock in/clock out time at FedEx, it is changed actively thoughout the week. If you're part time you might have anywhere from 15 to 32 hours a week based on how much work there is to be done, and how long you are willing to stay each day. If you aren't a work horse beware, because this job gets to a point where its not the physical effort you have to put in to lift boxes; (which, to be fair, are usually light) its about how monotonous the job can be, the work never changes, your job will be to take a box, scan it, and put it somewhere else for however long every day, so good luck with that. This job has more of equipment, sharp edges, and heavy lifting than usual, so becareful, and steel-toe boots could help out a lot.","Mar 7, 2017 ", Part Time Package Handler

1490,4.0,Former Employee,Just  my observation - but shared by so many grunts who bleed purple.,Flex Time and Bonuses were good.  But the greatest reason to work for FedEx is the people (non-management).  They are the most down earth set of people you could work with.,"FedEx's Low Level Managment to the CIO lack vision and direction, despite management's propaganda.  Many of FedEx Services problems are the reflection of the leadership in the management chain.  It's not what you know but who you know.  But this mantra has caught up to FedEx as it eventually catches up to most companies.  Middle management is more concerned with climbing up the corporate chain than doing what is right for the company, the stockholders, or the employees.  The Executive Management is so out of touch with was occurring at FedEx Services because they rely on middle management to be concise, ethical, and to the point.  However, as most work places including FedEx Services, middle management tells senior management what they want to hear rather than tell them how it really is. 

If you don't believe my commentary.  Ask a FedEx Services employee how successful 6x6 or 6x6 Reloaded was/is (off the record) in Memphis, Dallas, Colorado Springs, and Orlando?  For the brave souls who bleed purple will tell you it was/is a joke.  The biggest joke is the CIO, the Senior Vice Presidents, and the Vice Presidents, the most useless executives that the FedEx subsidiary could have assembled.  This management team should be dismantled and rebuilt.   Managing Directors and Managers should be terminated for three consecutive poor Pulse Survey Reviews.

1532,4.0,"Former Employee, more than 10 years","Operations Manager, FedEx Express","FedEx is a diverse company with a lot of opportunities.  My experience is at Express as a driver and manager for many years.  Couriers can make a decent living wage.  The job is physically demanding but rewarding for those who refuse to sit at a desk.  Couriers are not required to have college experience, but can make comparable wages.  The culture is good, though seems to be less customer centered as time goes on.  If you like to move around FedEx has the ability for couriers to transfer to any other available positions in other stations/cities.  Great if you want to see lots of places.  

As far as management, it was a good job as well.  Comp is fair, but not highly performance based.   It's the type of job that uses the same skills every day, but no two days are alike.  Managers have some flexibility as far as their schedules.  Once your team has launched and all is well, you can go on road and spend time one-on-one with employees, which is fun.  Peak is a pain and 2 straight months of 55 hours weeks, depending on where you live though, they great summers can efficiency of the FedEx machine make up for it.","Pay for performance is very poorly done at FedEx.  New employees likely start at the same wages their peers are making after having been there for several years.  Its not equitable and creates a lot of resentment in the workforce that's hard to overcome.  Due to route structures, bidding, seniority, there is a lot of entitlement among the employees as well.  Essentially they reward the most experienced, best drivers with the easiest routes and schedules pushing the harder work on the newbies (and even after 5-10 years, you might still be a newbie with the amount of tenure in the workforce).

As a manager, your roles are so specialized because FedEx is so huge, that you are constantly pigeon holed into positions that don't offer continued growth.  You have to be aware of that and work your way through it if you want to move up.  Too, there is a terrible misalignment of goals to hit unrealistic numbers.  What happens in the Company makes their plan, the EVPs divided it up (leaving a little in their back pockets)... then the RVPs hang on to a little extra... then the division guys do it, too so eventually the stations end up with FTE goals that are impossible to hit.  You burn out your people and everything is negative because your station cant reach the target, meanwhile the roll up numbers are just fine and your employees could have been celebrating their good work.  Just a lot of misaligned incentives at ""good ol boy"" FedEx.","Jul 2, 2014 ", Operations Manager

Some allow you to come in a little earlier than others and leave a little early or come in a little later and leave a little later as long as it overlaps what most consider a normal day. Pay and benefits are good though maybe not excellent. Still have an opportunity to move up or around in the company (though not as easy as it was at one time).

Benefits are not as good as they once were but not sure how they compare with other companies. Out of pocket expenses can be high initially and for medical procedures.

1606,2.0,Current Employee,Looking For A Sales Career~Do Not Work Here,"Unfortunately, FedEx has changed a great deal over the course of the last several years. Unfortunately, the cons outweigh the pros.  If you are thinking that it is a blessing to have a job in this tight economy maybe you will look at the pros.  A sales career is not an ideal position for any college graduate looking to advance with this corporation. Let's look at the pros of a sales career at FedEx.

1) Flexiability - but this is true of sales professions at many corporations across America.

2) Stability- If you work for FedEx in a sales role (like UPS), it is highly unlikely that you will be laid-off.  Sales people are revenue driving force in the organization. FedEx and UPS (I have worked for both) recognize this; therefore, it is unlikely you will lose your job due to the economy.

3) Overall, FedEx has a good insurance package. The dental is not competitive. You can purchase a better dental insurance package from an outside company that offers a better plan and the same cost or a little less.

4) FedEx is one of the few companies offers their employees a pension. The organization is reinstating the 401K match. It was suspended during the recession.

5) FedEx does not like to lay-off employees. Unfortunately, the economy has caused some lay-offs. However, FedEx does so when the organization has no other option.  Compared to many companies, layoffs have been very low during the recession.  In this respect, FedEx does care about their employees.","Working as a field Account Executive at FedEx is a low-paying thank less job.   The salary would be fair if you were working a 40-45 hour a week job.  If you are going to be an effective sales person by hitting your numbers and closing new business, you will work long hours.  This might not be a problem if you are compensated for your efforts. 

Also, the job does not really require that an individual work as long if management allowed their employees to manage their time effectively to get the tasks completed to get new packages ‚Äúon the belt.‚Äù  There is a lot of administrative work. The FedEx internal systems are low and outdated. If the sales employees were hourly, I am certain that the organization would work on streamlining many of their internal processes to save their employees time and to make the job easier. 

FedEx does not believe that their sales people are intelligent individuals who can make business decisions.  This can be seen by how they manage their people.  Your focus is not just sales.  You are the customer service person for every account in your territory even for account that you do not receive commission for‚Ä¶ FedEx has the practice of giving the Sales Executive cell phone to everyone‚Ä¶ Any person who finds your card will be calling you.  It was ridiculous.  The list of problems with this position goes on and on. 

If you want to have a life outside of FedEx, do not apply here. If you want to spend time with your family, do not apply here. If you want to spend your evenings watching television while working on FedEx pricing contracts or responding to e-mails almost every night of the week, then this is the JOB for you. 

I do not mind hard work. I was an effective sales person‚Ä¶ BUT PAY ME FOR MY EDUCATION, PROFESSIONALISM, TIME AND EFFORT! This is truly the JOB from HELL!  For those you read this post, I was not a poor performer. I always had good reviews and brought on large accounts.  I attempted to give this company my best during the time I was employed there and make the best of a BAD situation until a new door opened.  It is not worst it!  

In addition, to all of these problems, the promotion process is nearly impossible within sales department.  As an account executive, you can only be promoted to a sales executive (which is the same position with a new title). Your pay increases significantly, but the requirements change almost yearly and the company makes it almost impossible to get promoted. There are a very limited number of corporate and worldwide account manager positions. People who have those positions rarely resign or quit. When one becomes available everyone is trying‚Ä¶ promotion regardless of work ethic is nearly impossible.  UPS promotes their people fairly; FedEx does not. I have worked for both‚Ä¶ At UPS, I was respected and treated like the educated individual that I am. At FedEx, I was a robot without a brain.","Jan 13, 2010 ", Field Account Executive

Good vacation benefits.  Medical benefits used to be good, but were getting severely cut around the time I left.","Boring isn't a strong enough word to describe the work.  I had days where even after 9 hours of sleep the night prior, I would still have to struggle so hard to stay awake that it was physically painful.  The environment is horribly stale.  Quiet.  No decorations.  The work experience is a drudgery grind.

And this would be fine, if employees were allowed to engage in periodic distraction.  A glance at something on the web now and then is enough to keep the brain awake.  Consider also that you're given hard metrics on productivity, so it really shouldn't be a problem if you stay within them.

But no distractions of any kind are officially permissible except for listening to music through headphones.  Doing absolutely anything else with your time while in the office provokes politics.  You could produce the highest numbers in the office and then get in trouble for being unproductive for 10 minutes - not exaggeration, this literally happened.

The regional manager is also horribly obsessive-compulsive - once demanding that my co-worker put his monitor in the same position on his desk as everyone else on the cubicle block, even though doing so aggravated his carpal tunnel.  

The politics are ridiculous.  Favoritism runs deep and rampant.  Upper management will create rules just to bully and micromanage certain employees they don't like, while nothing is enforced on others.  Most of the favorites were people who were barely productive, and spent most of their time trying to get productive employees in trouble for sport.  And the excessively detailed rules created the perfect environment for bullying to take place.

There was one clique in particular who produced the lowest numbers in the office, worked several hours of overtime every day even during periods where anybody else would get written up for clocking out 1 minute past 8 hours, and they would pick on people relentlessly.  They would rotate targets for harassment, and take turns walking past their target's desk periodically to see what they were doing.  If it was anything other than focusing exclusively on work, they would immediately complain, and that person would get written up.  This was an ongoing state of affairs for all 7 years I worked in that office.

Also, any communication regarding pay or the value of your work from corporate was always extremely insulting.  Best example:  there is a fundraising drive every year for United Way.  Every year they show a promotional video.  One year, they had one of the company's top executives introduce the video by saying ""We're all feeling the effects of the economic recession"", while wearing his immaculate suit and politician's smile.  They then proceeded to show a little documentary bit about how *one of our own co-workers* didn't make enough money to take care of her kid, and how United Way helped her to make ends meet.  And then asked us to donate...","Sep 28, 2014 ", Senior ECO Import Agent

Depending on where you work, you may be plagued with endless meetings. Very often meetings are held not to get input from participants but to disseminate information that could be easily distributed with an email.

There is little room for advancement, in particular technical advancement. The Advisor positions which were created years back might have been used for a more advanced technical position, at least in technical groups, but they are primarily political in nature. Every 'Principal' position - the highest level non-management job - was filled by the buddy system, which is rampant in my particular org.

When I came to work for this company, I truly believed that it was an organization that cared about their employees.  I thought it was a company where I could advance, grow and use the full range of my educational abillities.  Unfortunately, after working for the company for almost 5 years,  I have discovered that things are changing greatly at FedEx.   FedEx is not a company that cares about their employees.  I understand that the economic conditions are impacting this organization. However, I was very disappointed when the news revealed that I would be receiving a pay deduction before I was aware. To make matters worse, I opened an e-mail to read about the changes that would be effective immediately. I had to call my manager for clarification. This information was not proactively provided to me.  What a disappointment? Did the company care about me? I wanted notification so that I could make the necessary adjustments and pay. To add insult to injury, the press release said that the pay deduction would be permenant and I would not receive a merit increase in 2009.  I would be a little more accepting if the company was committed to bringing me back up to the my current salary level after the economic situation improves. There was no commitment.  Health insurance costs continue to increase as well.

Benefits are decent.","Political.  Not much standardization for the sales force i.e., a type of sink or swim environment with tools flying at us that are not properly tested before we get them.  These take up time we dont have but are required to use, only to have the next new thing be dumped on us a few weeks later.  It is like a contest to see who can make a name for themselves by coming up with a new technique and after that we have to work out the bugs.  By that time, another tool or training will be required.      We supposedly are given warm leads, but approx 40% of the spreadsheet are companies out of business, havent shipped in over 10 years, etc.  To close the sale we have to use a process, which means if a customer wants to ship with us the same day we call, we cannot close it unless we have a minimum of 3 calls.  AND we have to move the sale through a ""certainty' rating, which means  we have to log the close as 25% sure, then 50% sure, then 75%, 90% then close it.   Many dont do it this way and just make sure they have the minimum 3 calls.  No one seems to believe that an inside sasales professional can know if the customer is wanting to ship in one or 2 calls.  Also, we now have a phone system that allows management to listen to our calls so there is the Big Brother aspect.  

Managers play favorites and there is no recourse to this as the manager network is tight.  I.e., it would do no good to report one as blatantly applying the rules according to their personal preferences vs. what is fair and equitable.  

The sales job requires a minutia of extraneous tasks in additional to actual selling.  The systems we have are not user friendly and it requires using 4-5 places to find all the information necessary to track our calls, pull up information about the customer and track the customer's shipping for closes.  There is a lag time to seeing how a customer is shipping, we have to wait 1-2 days to get pricing approved for them, etc.  And after we bring on an account and grow it, we then have to give it to the field sales reps who usually have not done a single thing to work the account.  Any objections will be answered with:  ""It's the right thing for the customer.""   Everyone in sales knows this is an untruth.   The other thing about field sales is FedEx seems to have a preference for hiring outside for field and had no problem hiring 70 layed off DHL reps which took promotional opportunities away from internal employees.

2221,3.0,Former Employee,The world of FedEx,"It‚Äôs very difficult to review FedEx and no one opinion can be generalized to reflect how this company works.  Being a large company it in a way works like the world itself.  There are some good parts that make you proud and there are some parts that will totally annoy and drive you out of the company.  So opinions will largely depend on which part do you face the most.  On overall level and it‚Äôs a well respected company led by a visionary. It‚Äôs in a good position in the industry as there are high barriers to entry especially on the Express and Ground business.   FedEx being in logistic domain is operationally driven company and luckily the management and systems are very strong where they should be.  If you work in the operation area this is a best place to work as company‚Äôs focus as well as all the services including IT are dominant in this area. However, if you work in shared services like Marketing or Sales this may seem like a terrible place as everything seems inferior in this area, management, systems.  FedEx is well known for path breaking advances in IT, but if you are in Services area, the IT support is abysmal.","Experience and opinion of FedEx are also largely shaped by individuals and their career aspirations.  For many folks, working in a stable company and living in an inexpensive place is more important and this place is ideal for them.  But if you are advanced degree holder looking for a good career growth this is not the place for you.  Career growth and  promotions especially in the management depend upon open position.  For every promotion you will have to apply for the position and compete with many individuals.  So even if you perform at the highest level there is no guarantee that you will get promoted as there may not be open positions and even if there is one, 20-30 people may be vying for the same job.  Many times the individual is chosen before all the interviews take place and then many people interview just so that hiring manager can complete the formality. 
This also leads a good point, being a large company the experience of FedEx largely depends on the Vice Presidents of the area.  If you are stuck in a group with ineffective or politically motivated VP, then you are out of luck.  I know of a VP who used to promote all his friends or well wishers or other reasons which are more speculations that known facts so not worth mentioning.  Most of his promotion decisions bombed but it still goes on.  He used to conduct interview even for regular promotions with no additional responsibility and give job to someone he likes and tell others that they didn‚Äôt interview well.   At the same time I also know of VPs who always strived to do what is right.","Jun 18, 2012 ",

Major compensation issues in regard to being equally fair accross the board. The culture has changed, before the ""merger"" with RPS, the company truly put the employees first and followed the policy  of treat your employees well, and in turn your employees will provide the best possible service to our customers, and therefore profitability will follow. The policy worked for years but when the merger happened the employees were no longer treated with respect and were treated as if they were a liability that could be replaced on a whim. Also management by intimidation has become the culture of the day, with the new performance review system and the sales professionals and sales manager no longer have the empowerment to make decisions in which they could have made prior to 1999, and no longer able to run their perticular district or region as they wanted to.

I would love to show pictures of the rusted piece of crap truck we just got rid. I'm sure investors would be interested in knowing what's really going on at Fedex. They take vehicles from station that some coffee dog in Memphis says the station doesn't need even though he/she doesn't have a friggin clue what the stations vehicle needs are. They put 2 wheel drive vehicles in parts of the country that need 4 wheel drive. Having 4 wheel drive vehicles is what separates us from the competition but upper management is too stupid to figure it out. The give us a raise and then raise our rates.

There are around 30 other people doing the same thing as you so seniority is going to play a big role in promotions.  They start you at around $14 or $15 per hour.  And you get like 2% raise each year, so you do the math. You will have to put in 4+ years just to get $1 raise.  There are other reviews here that proves it could be worse than the example i gave you.  At these kind of pay, a single person cannot survive since rent alone is around $1,000 + utilities for a studio.

They hire minorities(some can't even speak proper English) who would otherwise have a hard time finding a job.  If you are a white person, don't bother applying to Sr. Entry coordinator positions at the LA/Torrance (soon to move to Gardena) location because they have filled these low level jobs with minorities. Great move by the senior management at the HQ in Memphis.  They can claim to be a equal opportunity employer saying they have this many minorities in the company and this many minorities in management.  But if you look deeper into the company, you will see the minorities are at the very bottom in job level and pay.  The higher you go, the whiter it gets.  They have minorities in management positions at this LA locations, but these supervisor/managers are just puppets.  They have no authority over anything.  All the decisions are made in Memphis.

This is the biggest employer in Memphis so they pretty much can treat their employees any way they want and we'd have to put up with it.  The Vacation and Benefits are outdated as compared to other companies of it's size.  Management is great at saying things that sound good without any follow through. All the systems are old and outdated and the one new system they have promoted as a ""savior"" has landed is the biggest thud in history.   The new system makes our job 5x harder because it just will not work. So we're still being told to work harder even though we have bad tools to work with.

You have others that don't want to be here, but are waiting for another buyout to leave.  Even applying for internal positions is very political.  In some cases if you want to even be considered for the job, you have to go and talk to the manager and  kiss up to them  a little otherwise your resume won't even be called for an interview.

The senior manager needs to be replaced ASAP. She is running that place into the ground and has been for years. She is vindictive, manipulative, and will find a way to get rid of you if you disagree with her in any capacity. If you make her mad enough, she'll completely make something up to try and get you fired. The employees there have seen it happen multiple times. Her and the majority of management do not care about any of the employees or their well being. Favoritism is an issue as well. 
The pay is laughable. They try to call the job a call center, though nothing about it is like a call center. They pay low wages because they consider it one, although new hires get hired on now making more than the supervisors even do, or the employees that have worked there for 15+ years. The senior manager is trying to force all the tenured employees out the door so that she can replace them with people that don't question her and are younger and more productive. 
The workload is insane. They have mismanaged things so badly that employees are having to take on literally 4X the normal amount of work, and management doesn't do anything about it because they know that ""it'll get done one way or another"".  The list goes on and on. Turnover and attrition are at an all time high. People are quitting right and left. 
 Run so far away from this circus and go work for someone who values you. Go work for any other branch of FedEx even.  You will also have absolutely no work life balance. Expect to work massive amounts of overtime because there is so much work constantly.","Jun 30, 2017 ", Team Lead

-new web based systems are being forced on the agents and they crash hourly because the servers aren't strong enough 
-new phone system is a joke. Customers aren't even able to leave a message. Team leads are forced to micromanage employees every second of the day.

If you want a job that you can sit in for the next 40 years and do the same thing day in and day out, this is the place for You! Management is useless, they will never have your back and cower to sales every chance they get.  You will only get a promotion after working there about 10 years and that will be only if HR makes them because you're maxing out the salary grade.  The only other way you're getting promoted is if you're on project work, but the catch is, they pick the same people (favorites) to do project work over and over.  So don't bet on that.  The work is demeaning and draining every second of everyday!  Sales will literally treat you like dirt under their feet.  They will belittle you, harass you, and treat you down right unprofessionally without repercussions and in most cases your manager will not have your back or defend you or the team in any way. Finally, because of most of the things I've mentioned and more I didn't, we have had a FLOOD of people leaving the department which makes more and more work and stress for the people who remain since they can't hire people fast enough.

Some Workgroups do have adequate benefits.  The executive management group has an excellent pay, retirement, and bonuses.  There retirements benefits are outstanding, retirement pay, and retirement medical.  

As for the majority of employees the pay is inadequate, the health insurance is sold to the employees for a high price with very poor coverage.  The traditional pension plan was discontinued, and frozen.  They have a very inadequate cash Pension Plan that will pay a minimum token amount when the employee leaves after 20 years.  It is based on your salary and time in service, and applied to a company account every three months with a interest rate of 1% every three months.  That ADDS up to 4% the year, and you do not control the money in the account.  It is controlled by the company.  

Many of the retirees are struggling with the health insurance.  The retirees have to pay $700 to $1,000 a month for coverage for two people.  This is no better than Cobra coverage.  

Many people go to work for large companies for the benefits,  health insurance and retirement knowing that this was promised at the beginning of their employment with this company.

Well not here they seem to be all from Memphis. They are clueless what markets need attention to grow business and they seem to run both operations and office environments with minimal employees. The next biggest thing for FTN is to grow Air and Ocean to overtake the competition but, they lack the tools, employees, and leverage with carriers to do this. They also want to utilize Fedex Freight to grow their trucking business. I find this strange because most forwarders don't put their focus in the trucking business.

So it is very cliquey. If the non-stop irate calls and the co-workers are not stressful enough, you get no support from the managers.  In fact, they might say they have an open door policy - but that does not mean they are actually willing to listen to any of your concerns or helpful suggestions ... Lest you have a complaint.  They will only preach to you the corporate policies to make you get ""on-board"" with the program.  Once I had a problem with a manager that kept bullying me.  I mean a manager that treated me like a kindergartner and told me to do things because ""she said so"".  When I approached the Sr. Mgr. with my concerns, the response was ""Let's use this as a coaching opportunity for you"".  In other words, the complaint will get nowhere.  So I better shut up and take it.  I realize now the mentality of a large corporation and how management is only there to back each other up.  It's such a shame as I was a hard-working employee that tried to do my best to keep up with the high call volume and consistently be empathetic and helpful to the customers that were in an awful predicament without the delivery of their package.  Other departments at FedEx might be great.  But this particular department has only gone downhill.  It is a nasty cut-throat abusive environment. They expect Trace Reps to be the customer's advocate.  But the management is not there to be the Trace Agent's advocate.  The job is terrible and is always in a ""crisis"" mode with your taking a beating for FedEx on almost every call.  Yes, that is understood that is what you signed up for.  But the job could be so much more tolerable with sympathetic and supportive managers and less Corporate politics and the ever growing rules that add more burden than assistance to the job/employee itself.  The whole department is a pressure cooker waiting to explode. I would not wish this job on my friends ... buy maybe my worst enemies - Yes.","Oct 31, 2015 ", Trace Agent

This is a place where management actually cares about its employees.  Recently with the economy going through a rough patch it would have been very easy to layoff people, right before Christmas no less.  Instead, upper management took the biggest salary cuts and reduced our salaries by 5% and no one lost their job.  I eliminated my personal trainer (a luxury item) to make up the difference in pay.  No big deal whatsoever.  I have the ability to work from home if necessary.  This is a very laid back place to work where if you are talented and get your work done on time you will be successful.  People who are self-motivated and hard-working will definitely love this company.  You will be rewarded for your hard work.  I would say about 90% of management is promoted from within the organization.","This is not a technology company so any projects you work on are driven by a business need and not a technology need.  You will not invent the next ""gizmo"" here.  This is more a place where you take the ""gizmos"" other people create and implement them in a way that makes sense to the company's business needs.

This is a company that really understands the fact that their business is dependent on their labor workers, and they treat them well.  The pay is great, with wage increases happening every 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months, and then every year for four years.  The benefits are great, after six months of employment part timers are eligible for PTO and other benefits, as well as the opportunity to switch to full time.  The management staff really seems to have a legitimate care about safety and are very encouraging, motivating, and polite.  Management thanks package handlers after every shift and every two weeks or so they have a ""package handler appreciation day"" and give out cookies, cupcakes, or even sometimes a catered snack such as bagels or hot dogs.  Also, they will tell you that FedEx is one of the few places where you can start as a package handler and work your way up without a college degree, and it is true that hard workers are quickly spotted and promoted.  This is a great job for someone who is willing to provide tough physical labor, and can be great as a summer job or as a career starter.","Hard work
Hours (Depending on your shift)
Weather

The cons that I listed are not really FedEx's fault...  Just know that while you are paid well and given great benefits, this is a labor based job and you are expected to work hard for the duration of your shift (usually 3-4 hours off season, but as much as 5 during busy season).  The warehouses are not climate controlled so it is very hot and muggy in the summer and you WILL sweat, so make sure you bring a water bottle.  Management is very understanding and they provide gatorade and allow you to take short breaks to fill your bottle during your shift.  Also, some of the shifts are terrible hours (like 3AM - 8AM or 9PM to 2AM), but these shifts are also paid more and often are easy to get hired into, if you are willing to alter your sleep schedule.  Overall though, all of the cons relate to the nature of the job and not the company itself.","Jul 6, 2012 ", Package Handler

Job is pretty secure as long as you can work fast and accurately on repetitive tasks - they are always looking to increase the team.  Pay is fine for a first job in a corporation. Some opportunity to 'move up' eg. as a team leader.","Lots of compulsory overtime which to be fair is paid well (100% more), sometimes an hour extra per day, sometimes shorter, occasionally even longer than an hour. Overtime depends on when the tasks are finished by the whole team, so you cannot predict what time you'll go home in advance. 

Lots of pressure to work quickly. Tasks are repetitive but you have to keep alert in case of anything unusual.  This can be a bit stressful.

Holidays are very inflexible and you may not be granted your request, even if you ask months ahead of time - this applies to several months in the year, not only the obvious flashpoints like Christmas or August.  No Polish national holidays are given automatically - you may take the day off at a different time instead or be paid extra.

Be aware that if you are a 'native' English speaker, or near native then you may well be asked to join the small team calling out to customers.
