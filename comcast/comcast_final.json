I am saying this because this is not just another review from a \"disgruntled employee.\" I like Comcast, and want them to get better. \n\nThe onboarding commission was misleading. I thought I was going to be paid out at 100% for three months. Not only is this not enough time to build a book of business, but Comcast was misleading. 100% Month 1, 75% Month 2, and 50% month three is hardly enough to build a portfolio and a living in South Florida. This is one of the most expensive markets.\n\nThis is a review from a high-performing employee and I hope that the person who is reading this (and Comcast) takes this as honest constructive feedback. In hindsight I am ashamed of myself and why I have stayed with the company for so many years. I have unwittingly become part of the problem.\n\nComcast tells us to recruit small minority business partners (this is actually in our training- to target minority business owners) to enable them to sell residential services and then does not pay the Comcast Authorized Dealer (the business we signed up for). This has been an ongoing issue that the company is aware of for at least 6 years and has done nothing to fix it. The way Comcast gets around this is to hire a contractor (Actify or Leapfrog) and then pass the buck to them (it is their fault the partner is not getting paid). There have been literally times where dealers have come to me in tears due to the fact they have not received payment. In fact, during all my tenure at Comcast, I have never been able to reconcile a missed payment for a dealer. I am beginning to believe this is being done on purpose to exploit minority business partners because I have voiced my concerns to management over the past several years and nothing has been done about it. This is not a \"woke\" policy and needs to be closely looked at.\n\nAs an Indirect Account Executive if you do not \"recon\" a postpaid sale in a timely manner (before the sale is installed) the small business partner does not get paid. There is no system to pay the dealer. This makes you have to carry your company device at all hours of the day and night. This has caused significant mental health and physical health ailments because I have not been able to fully disconnect from my job in several years and caused me to be hospitalized on more than one occasion. I have not been able to go on a real vacation since I have been with the company. This has to do with dealer pay and account executive compensation. It is a major problem.\n\nComcast has missed employee commission paydays on more than two occasions causing myself and others to pay bills late and incur late charges. No explanation was given.\n\nThe overall comp for this position is below industry standards. I have exceeded large sales gains every year I have been with the company, and my pay gets lower and lower. There needs to be a better way to incentivize a salesperson. The way that goals have been calculated has never been properly explained in the Florida region. Your guess as to how I get paid is as good as mine. Many times goals have been loaded into Infoquest two and three weeks into the month making your ability to impact your commission check futile.\n\nI have no idea still as to what it takes to get a promotion here. I have applied two times for advancement, and I am well qualified. Both times NO feedback was given to me. This I feel is not a good use of company resources as all of us want to get better at our craft. Clear feedback should be given to candidates after you spend all the time necessary to properly prepare for an interview. Due to this happening to me multiple times I stopped applying for roles within the company. Comcast engages in talent hoarding.\n\nThere have been several occasions where Comcast has not paid out commissions to the Indirect team causing my bills to not be paid on time. There was no reasonable explanation for this.\n\nThere was no budget for prospecting. Prospecting and attending community networking events cost money and is necessary for you to find prospects that will sell Comcast residential products. This came out of my own pocket.\n\nThe title of your job is Indirect Account Executive. Management expects you to sell the services yourself to customers if you are not meeting goals. I am all for that EXCEPT that if I am going to be directly selling, I expect to be compensated accordingly. Direct sales agents that are successful make a salary well above the six-figure range (Indirect Account Executives cannot make this amount due to the way goals are set in the Florida region). Recently, management has delivered \"door hangers\" and expects the indirect team to hang these on people's residential homes to drive business into retail and small business partners. This is not a good use of our time.\n\nComcast compensates small business partners 80-90% less for selling a residential double play than competitors like AT&T. Why has the compensation for dealers so disparagingly different? \n\nInterdepartmental communication when it comes to Prepaid Service is a major issue. There are many defective prepaid modems that are sold to customers from Boost Stores. The policy is that if the modem is defective the customer is supposed to call customer care, and they will send the customer another modem in the mail. But, due to a communication problem that has not been resolved for several years the customer comes back to the Boost Store, causes a scene (Boost is not equipped to handle returns), and then they have to exchange the modem at their expense.\n\nI have sent several proposals to management about solutions to these issues and have never received a response. This is typical of the culture and lack of accountability at Comcast.\n\nDuring COVID-19 there were no leadership or teleconference meetings with our former senior manager. There seems to be a lack of inspirational leadership when we needed it the most.", "The pay and how you are treated.", "Some departments have issues with morale", "Too comfortable too slow in adapting new technology", "They make your customer dialogue too scripted and it gets annoying quickly"]},

Picture being told 3/4 of the year you are doing a great job, then the metrics that determine your future schedule, think 3-10 PM Tuesday-Wednesday off, comes up and your manager will tell you looks like you aren't doing a good job better make those numbers before your performance review. \r\n\r\nManagers will micro-manage every moment they can and confront you if you are not productive enough by 'their standards' not based on performance at all.

Then this is the job for you. \r\n\r\nManagers task supervisors to find who writes bad survey responses about them.

Anyone that had previously questioned those goals and how the program was run (on my team) were excused after the company decided to \"restructure\" and have us interview....for our own jobs. \r\n-Company pride is one thing, but for the market we were tasked with selling to that pride looked like arrogance to the independent business owners we dealt with. Humility goes a long way within certain communities. \r\n-Mixed messages and inconsistent standards in the field. Expectations changed as the wind blows. After being a territory manager for the last 6 years I've never seen a company change their stance on expectations so sharply so frequently. The real issue is that none of those changes were reflective of the actual field team reports. They were decided by management that never set foot in the actual territories to see the similarities and differences within each market. My direct manager was awesome. He went to my glorious territory and saw the challenges and opportunities. That's not the issue. His direct management, the decision makers, didn't seem to value that feedback at all. It showed in the overall cohesion of the to teams, who scrambled and did their best with what they were handed on a day to day, and week to week basis. \r\n\r\nIn closing, the initiative was hastily put together, with little consistency or clear vision, and as the old saying goes, it rolls downhill. I watched tenured members of the team lose their livelihood with no explanation whatsoever. The \"why\". Covid seems to be an excuse for these unregulated, monolithic companies to take full advantage of hard working, honest, caring American workers, and if nothing else shows you to become your own business in some regard. The lesson? Any company that goes out of their way to show \"they care\" is masking something more insidious underneath. Be humble. Work hard. Do not voice any critique or even suggest changes.

My team was impressed with my ability to handle many high stakes projects with ease and often I was told as much. I was the guy that the junior level designers came to for tips and tricks. The bully was the designer who had been there the longest and had the most to lose from my rapid growth in hindsight. When it came time to promote said bully I was supportive because I had always been impressed by his competencies. Once he was promoted he began to treat myself and another team member like rivals. The time came for me to lead another high stakes project and this time with a few other team members made up of an junior level designer, the bully and the bully\u2019s intern. Yes, the bully had an intern that he not only hired but enlisted to bully me too. I was very excited for this opportunity to lead a team of designers at Comcast as it was a great growth opportunity. The bully undermined me almost everyday, even going as far as taking my team to another room in the building to generate concepts for my project without inviting me. My boss and the bully were buddies. So when I brought up my concerns my boss didn\u2019t give any importance to my claims. I confronted the bully and tried to clear the air in hopes that we could work better together. I was very diplomatic and felt upon leaving that discussion that progress was made. But the bully later sent me an email on a Sunday without CC\u2019ing my boss saying he was going to remove me from presenting a project and would do the presentation to the executive himself and that I would not be speaking, without any grounds to do so. I immediately forwarded the email to my boss asking for guidance. I really didn\u2019t know what to do, I just wanted this to stop, because I enjoyed my job and wanted to get back to that. There was a study from 2012 that concluded that once you are a target of a workplace bully, you are 77.7% likely to be terminated or quit. Well I was terminated and one of my team members that was bullied too quit shortly after citing the bully as the reason. I was a Senior level Designer and my team member that quit was a Lead level designer. I carried about 40-45% of the teams total work load and the Lead Designer carried about 10-15%. Losing us decreased the capacity of that team to deliver that amount of productivity because of this bully.

Spend 8 hours a day in an auto-dialer working tired, worn-out, unrefined leads...and sounding like a complete idiot on the majority of these calls while you're waiting for the computer screen to catch up to who you have on the phone.  You will call about 100 businesses each day (or more) and most of them hang up on you the instant they hear the word \"Comcast\".  Those that don't are likely already Comcast Business customers which shouldn't be in your list in the first place since the OBSR position's focus is NEW ACQUISITION.  But...in spite of the company being keenly aware of this problem, they do NOTHING about it other than encourage you to sell whatever lines of business the customer doesn't already have, regardless of whether it's a service that will benefit the business or not.  When I say worn out and tired leads, I'm also talking about the fact that the company recycles leads like crazy and changes the name of the list but not the leads in the list.  Here's the basic formula for the OBSR department: spend as little on leads as humanly possible and keep constantly hiring more poor suckers to call through them over and over again...then, after the Marketing OBSRs are done with a list, send it over to the Qualified OBSRs and call all those poor souls that didn't get weeded out of the list a few more times.\r\n\r\nAlso, you will call a TON of Home-Based Businesses that are already using Xfinity Residential Service and you're expected to flat out LIE to the customer about how much better Comcast Business service is to justify the much higher price point.  The truth is that there are only a few differences between Xfinity and Comcast Business and those are rather minor differences at best.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, Comcast has a TERRIBLE reputation in the industry and in spite of claiming that \"customer service should be our best product\" they are doing very little to back those words up with any sort of action.  At least once every couple days you'll call someone the company has burned in the past and that person is going to let you have it.  \r\n\r\nOne other thing to be aware of is that the company does not work together.  As a telemarketer, you'll fight to keep sales that the door-to-door guys will steal.  Other phone jockeys even in your same call center will also try to poach your deals.  Many of the technicians will tell your customers all kinds of crazy things to get out of doing their job.  Other departments are set up as checks and balances and will reject deals you submit for all kinds of silly bureaucratic reasons...which means your customer has to wait while the company foolishly fights amongst itself.  \r\n\r\nI could go on here all day listing cons...but these things above are the major issues.  The bottom line is, if you don't mind making a total fool of yourself through no fault of your own, telling people outright lies in order to get deals, and working for a company that people truly hate...it's not a bad place to work, at least while you keep interviewing at other places where one can take pride in being an employee there.  However, if you're any sort of decent salesperson who has ethics, integrity, and any sort of moral compass, you're not going to want to stay there long.

The job is demanding but can be worth it.", "There are many complicated pre and post sales processes that interfere with one's ability to prospect and make sales.  A high quota and ever decreasing average deal size adds challenge and stress to meeting goals.  Selling involves a high amount of documentation and tedious steps to process a sale and therefore may not be a fit for candidates who dislike spreadsheets and micro management.  The company develops agent /indirect partners and hires inside sales reps that directly compete with the EAE for the same customers / sales.  Your territory is not really your territory.  They move your customers away from you to an account manager after 12 months.  So, you often only get a small piece of the customer's potential sales before it becomes someone else's benefit to reap what you sewed.   It is not true Enterprise, nor even mid market very often.  70% of sales are single location Internet and voice service.  They claw back commissions if a customer does not get installed and it happens semi-frequently due to construction delays and less ideal performance by a constructiin or project management partner.  The sales rep incurs 100% of the risk but has little control over outcome.  The company routinely makes changes to processes designed to help a different department, like operations, but adds new burdens on sales people and negatively impacts customer experience.  Comcast Business does not sell globally, therefore it is not addressing a large potential customer segment which limits your potential sales.   Incentives and salary compensation are about 40% lower than current market price for a similar role in other technology companies.  There is high churn due to the issues mentioned above and the amount of stress, patience and capability that it takes to ramp and succeed in the role.", "Re-orgs are often, low pay, low motivation, not a lot of young people but getting better!", "You get 30 minute lunches", "Communication from the top is turrible", "Difficult to be heard, large company that moves slowly when effecting change, sometimes you see some nepotism going on, but overall not too bad.", "Its a very large company so your personal experience can vary widely depending on your specific team and manager.\r\n\r\nIf you are ambitious and looking to accomplish great things you will find a lot of cultural resistance. There is a tendency to do work for the sake of staying busy, and not to actually accomplish anything. A lot of groups are protective of their own processes/work and resistant to potentially positive changes. \r\n\r\nManagement tends to treat every single project as the most critical which ultimately leads to a lack of trust - especially when internal products or project results are dropped within weeks of completion. Personally I have just completed my third project in a row where the finished product has gone ignored by the same stakeholders who were stating how vital the project was for the company's success. \r\n\r\nThere is an overall lack of accountability when it comes to project success.  Projects can slip in terms of budget and timeline by several months and hundreds of thousands of dollars and sponsors or project managers will simply move the goal posts. Very rare to have any revisiting of projects a year+ later to see if the business case has panned out or if returns have been met. No sense of lessons learned and mistakes are very often repeated. \r\n\r\nBe careful about promises of internal movement/promotion, especially across functions. Its possible to be able to advance through job openings on other teams, but it will be entirely on you to find these and pursue them. There is no sense in the broader company of an internal talent marketplace and often managers will look outside first - in my opinion this is due to lack of support from the talent acquisition teams. The Career Profile was advertised as a solution to this, but I have yet to hear about a success story where an individual was contacted by other groups within the company for opportunities or to work on new projects, or of any manager who used this tool when making a hiring decision. Your own resume, LinkedIn profile, and networking will do a lot more for your internal career growth than the Career Profile will.", "I have no major complaints", "No freedom, have to lie to customers to make money"]},

They Listen - and then they fire you. knowing that Corporate is lazy and uncaring, Supervisors will just keep writing you up, keep lying on you, until they can just fire you.\r\n\r\nThe training is a joke - but on top of that if you ask them they will warn you about trying to learn more on your own as if it's a violation. Techs are given no time to learn anything anyway, as they are worked to death, in a rush and no care about safety. They do the old \"You have to do all this, we know you have no time to do it... but that's on you to figure out\" game. or example, we were told we are not to do wall wishes anymore, but in an unclear manner. When you try to clarify it with a definitive yes or no, they won't give you that - instead they keep putting in a way that basically says \"The real answer is no - but we want you to just do it anyway AND DONT GET CAUGHT...\".\r\n\r\nAll they care about is numbers. If the Supervisor is incompetent, he starts firing all the new or under performing people on his team. The refuse to change the companies expectations to be more realistic. Most other companies in this industry expect up to 5 jobs per day. (At&T for example - who pays double the salary for half the work). Comcast wants you to do 11 - 15 jobs per day. They trivialize some of the jobs as \"only trouble calls\", but for one, they give you a shortage of ten minutes  (20 minutes in an hour) of time to do them, and second, if the trouble call requires more work - which 80% fall in this category - they do not give you more time without punishment. They under time you and then punish you because of their mistake. Then they brow beat you, telling you it's your fault that your team-mates have more work to do, when in fact it is because they are slamming you with too much work and not making adjustments when the work becomes more than they thought it would be. \r\n\r\nThe  discipline system is designed to cycle through workers. HR , Management, Corporate - they have nice secure jobs, support and a quality appeal in times of unfairness. But the workers beneath them are fired for TWO UNRELATED OCCURRENCES! TWO??? And as I explained earlier - they don't care how they came about, or who wrote them. I had lies placed in my files, I protested them, they acknowledged them - and then LEFT THEM. Over a half a year later HR calls me in (they don't tell you why until you get there) and terminates me. The issues they wrote me up about were untrue - but despite going all the way up the ladder to Corporate about it, all they did was ask the same people who lied about me for more incidents, and then told me I did these \"other things\" so they are going to let the defamation stand and allow me to stay un-vindicated and unemployed. This is how they work! They rather keep corrupt Supervisors there, wasting money continuously training new hires than get rid of the rats sinking the ship.\r\n\r\nOh and one more thing about training. Its barely enough. They rush you through training, and then they throw you out in the field. The Supervisor can pull you out of training and have you do jobs if he feels like it - even if you really don't know anything. They dont care if you get it or not - even the teachers complain how ridiculous the training is. If you speak out about the horrible experiment - which is what their training sessions are - they treat you like you have a learning disability and start working on firing you. They have little meetings about you behind your back so you cannot defend yourself and then come at you with a decision, often misrepresenting you.\r\n\r\nThe real irony here is when they have meetings they ask workers and evry meeting - for YEARS, the workers bring up the ridiculous expectations. Management acknowledges it, offers some BS solutions, says they are working on it - but yet Techs are still getting fired behind it. They will not suspend the broken evaluation system even though they know it is antiquated and does not match up to the changes in the Tech's job. Furthermore, other supporting departments, like Dispatch, are given Carte Blanche to shift issue responsibility on to the Techs - when they mess up the scheduling, which they do every day - the Tech gets punished because they can't perform on time. Management once again lies, saying Dispatch is held responsible - but they never take the blame off of the Tech - no, you SHARE that punishment, even if it's totally not your fault. Comcast is a complete mess, and it's a shame because it doesn't have to be. You want to see why your shares are not performing well? Look at the way they handle the Tech responsibilities - it is bleeding money and it isn't the fault of the Tech - it's the management who could care less about Comcast or the workers. They know it is broken and have given up, so they just let the bad stuff just keep rolling.", "severe lack of leadership or  internal communication/movitivation\r\ndo not invest in employees outside of benefits", "Nonstop changes are killing morale and productivity", "Good place for employment and career", "Gossiping high school atmosphere, micro managing"]},

HR has been asking employees if they know anyone who is black, Latino, disabled, etc that would like to work at the CMC. The fact that more emphasis is placed on a persons race, religion, gender, sexual orientation or other minority status than on that person's qualifications means that Comcast no longer cares if the job is getting done correctly, they care only have the public perceives their diversity.

The worst part for me: if you have a customer who wants a special request or has a unique issue that you don't know how to resolve, you are forbidden from asking a supervisor or manager for advice, instead you must place the customer on hold and then open a second line and call over to a support team or a supervisor line, then wait on hold for the next available agent, and usually get an unhelpful answer.

Comtechs never know when they will get home.  Scheduling of jobs is unrealistic.  Often times, big installs that will take hours are scheduled for late in the day.  If I got off my shift within an hour and a half of the scheduled end time I felt lucky.   Almost never got out on time.  They simply schedule too many jobs each day.  Then they say they want every step followed in the field, but there is no way to do it.   The math does not add up.  So, techs end up skipping steps like going to tap on every job.  If you want to be home at a reasonable time each night, this is not the place for you.  If you have little ones at home that go to bed early, forget seeing them because you will be at work if you are doing it all by the numbers.  If you are single or don't have a family to worry about spending time with, go for it, but if you value seeing your family at all during the week, it may not be the place for you.\r\n\r\nThey offer over 5500$ per year in tuition reimbursement but how do you go to college if you never know when you will be out of work.  Kind of tough to schedule classes around that.  \r\n\r\nBig disconnect between what is taught in training and what goes on in the field.  Almost everything they told us not to do in training is being done in the field so that people can try to get off somewhere near on time.  Also, they spend a lot of time in training telling us how to smile , tuck our shirts in and things like that, but some portions of training were way to short.  Internet installs are a big part of the job but we get about 2 days of training on that.  Not nearly enough.   But they will spend days on how to smile, approach the customer, wear our hard hats, and alot of other things that don't require so much.  They need to prioritize the training time more with the technology end before we are sent into field training.", "I think the sales side of the company is different from the customer care side.

Sometimes, I had to upgrade the firmware for the installed EMTA and that took 6-minutes. I know many of my co-workers would would perform incomplete installations to maintain their call quota times and production numbers thus many field technicians had to call back 2-3 times for troubleshooting help to complete their installations.\r\n\r\nDue to the nature of Comcast's services, customer service related and field technician support related work is seven-days a week so forget about Saturday and Sundays off.\r\n\r\nDo not count on job security.

Comcast certainly values their employees and invest a lot of their time and money in them.

I love that you can be truly be yourself at Comcast. They love families so you can work side by side with your daughter, son, spouse, aunt, cousin, friend, uncle, etc. As a gay male I have felt nothing but fully accepted and loved that a lot of the leadership was openly gay also, it certainly is a family environment and everyone is very supportive and helpful. I would have to say the good eggs certainly overshadow the bad ones. Comcast is a conglomerate and I love that they're are a variety of entities within the organization so do NOT limit yourself to just one position. You qualify for a transfer after just 6 months which is just amazing. Comcast truly is an exceptional service being that I have had them all, so you do get what you pay for. They do train the new hires properly, and even if you don't know everything (which you won't) it is okay just ask your peers they are more than helpful.

Didn't use to be like that several years ago but now it is all about metrics and sales. Extremely stressful . California shut down all Comcast call centers.", "Work-life balance is difficult especially if you are commission based because you will be basically forced to do overtime to maintain the level pay you have become accustom to. Customers really do determine your pay structure, you can be the best salesman available, however during months when college kids call to discontinue their service because they are going back home for the winter, you lose money from your pocket. When customers call to discontinue service because it is at their second home or vacation home, you lose money. Certain things that are out of your control you take a hit for it and are just told to OWN IT! Recently Comcast has made a decision to convert their system over to CSG database which has caused a huge headache for many agents across the country because not only were we poorly trained on the new system but the system was flawed during its release which caused customers accounts to screwed up but we could not fix the accounts because we did not have the tools to fix the job. So we were simply told to lie to the customer to get them off the phone and write down the account and hope that you remember to fix that one account after handling over 40 accounts a day 5 - 6 days a week if you worked OT or not. Vacation, flex, floating, and sick days are okay but if you are working in the call center with this high level stress you are going to use them up faster than you got them. And if you live in an area where the weather does potentially get bad around the winter season you are advised to save your flex just for those days which is unrealistic because sometimes you do need to take some time off just to recoup from all the negative energy you encounter with the customers over the phone. At the beginning of 2015 many co-workers suffered from heart attacks and even died because of the high level of stressing following the launch of the CSG conversion.", "No consideration for experience and/or education. Failure to adapt to a changing climate. Required customer service calls without the tools to completely resolve issue which takes time away from the rest of our duties, which are time-sensitive. Antiquated software and protocols.", "Oh where to start... Management is a joke in some departments. To get a manager to take a escalated call is like pulling teeth at times. I went through multiple management changes in the almost 5 years I worked there. I have a few good managers and a few managers that I wanted to escalate every call I was on just to make her life difficult on purpose. The ability to grow in the company was extremely limited. You had to be either exceptional at your job or know someone to get promotions. The customers wear you down and down and down. You will get called names, cursed at, yelled at. They expect the worst customer service because that is what Comcast is known for but when you try to turn around their perceptions and over come their roadblocks it's like pulling teeth. So when it comes to call quality and their cqe's (listening to your call and getting reviewed by it) it feels almost impossible to meet all the expectations. Training is a JOKE! Yes, the initial training is good but once your on the floor trying to keep up with everything feels impossible so sometimes your calls take longer than they should because you're digging through information making sure that this customer is eligible or that the information you know is correct. When I was there every few months they would announce they would set aside training hours but then never would follow through. The mandatory overtime wears you down, an 8 hour shift getting turned into 9 or a 10 into 11 wouldn't seem like much but it can add up. There is really no significant raises after you're hired. It's based on your performance but I believe the cap is .30 cents. You are somewhat micromanaged if you aren't meeting goals in what ever they are pushing you can get into trouble pretty quickly. Coaching is non existent though. Managers will be the first to pipe up if you're doing something wrong but rather than give helpful hints or anything to help you grow they kinda leave it at that. I worked there for quite some time and I didn't meet my sales goal ONCE and my manager had the audacity to say to me why are we hiring you if you can't do the job. Managers play favorites with staff.  Also I HATED rate increases and explaining them to the customer was extremely hard at times.

Don't get me wrong there are some really good people to deal with but   A lot of them expect way too much. They want it all but dont want to pay for it.

Oooh get me a job!", "My experience with my direct management team has not been a positive experience.  Despite the company's promise to provide a fair performance evaluation, if your manager does not \"like\" you personally they have an ability to destroy your future growth options with subjective feedback.\r\nWhile this can occur any place you work, complaints will get you no-where.

Comcast does not penalize you for having multiple children, no matter how many kids you have your insurance remains the same. People tend to get angry because they use all their flex (sick) time for pleasure and then get written up because they actually get sick and have no time left. I personally have needed to call out with zero notice twice since I've been with the company, and in neither case have I been written up. I think that the policy of calling out once in any rolling 30 days is completely rational, and of course if you don't agree with it you're tied to no contract so pack your desk and get out. Be greatful you have a job, you weren't guaranteed today, wake up glad you've got at least a few breaths left and take the call, that all be it miserable, is your call; look at the bright side you're getting complained to, or about, but knowing you did your best should be enough to satisfy you. Is it frustrating at times to work here, sure, but they call it work for a reason, I don't look at my wife and say \"I'm off to fun sweetheart,\" I say I'm off to work. So to wrap it up I'll say this is the job at times miserable, absolutely, but the main catalyst of this misery is employees that refuse to recognize a good thing when they have it. Comcast offers a great tuition reimbursment program, haven't seen much about that, two weeks PAID vacation in your first year, 8 PAID flex/sick days, and people complain, why, well simply put it's because they can't get their priorities straight. If you use a flex day for a hangover that's your ignorance, you knew you had to work the next day when you took that first drink, or stayed up late just to hang out and were too tired to work. Man up people, either take pride in what you do, or drop it and quit, Comcast is employing you, they didn't ask any of us to come here to work, we all asked them to let us come here.", "The benefits are great. \r\nYou get 401k with company match.\r\nYou get different medical, dental, and vision plans to choose from.\r\nYou can choose HSA and FSA and have your paycheck deposited to a debit card to pay for medical items.\r\nYou get courtesy services (free internet and cable service with premium channels).\r\nYou get paid double time and half when you work a holiday.\r\nYou get a lot of PTO to use.\r\nThe company has disability benefits to pay for wages when your sick or on maternity leave.\r\nYou get an opportunity to help people and you will learn very quickly how to handle escalated calls.", "The People.

There is also a tendency to overcommit to customers in terms of timelines and cost which often leads to constantly changing priorities as well as emergency fixes and deployments that might otherwise have been avoided.\r\n\r\n  Quite often large initiatives get implemented in parallel without a good understanding of the resources needed to bring them to market in a way that's sustainable.  This tends to leave them unstable,  partially finished, or not profitable.  This is likely a result of the constant push for the starting tomorrow's work while not leaving adequate resources to nicely finish up yesterday's work."]},

Comcast is an environment  where you can feel good about going to work everyday knowing that you will not need to conform to be successful, because the company WANTS you to be successful.

Further,  the ideas of new employees is welcomed and encouraged.  If you are not successful at this company it is at no fault of the organization.  I have heard the environment can be slightly different in remote locations (outside of Philadelphia headquarters). However it is also clear individuals that create hostile and uncomfortable type work environments are quickly removed.

When i worked out the math i saw that i was basically spending over $1,000 in gas per month for work expenses, not to mention car depreciation etc etc. I calculated it to about subtracting $10k to $15k from your total earnings to accommodate gas and wear and tear, which when i made $70k, 55k to 60k wasn't worth the difficulty of the position during the winter when people come home at 5pm and it gets dark at 6pm. you have to knock doors in the cold and in the dark untill about 7 or 8 pm, the cold you can deal with, but people in general are not receptive at door to door sales people, and in the dark it is a completely different animal. you may find an occasional person, but it is brutal going through neighborhoods in the dark knocking on their doors selling them cable.

Major re-orgs happen once a year, which only adds to the chaos.\r\nNo matter what you may think, Comcast is not a software company, and not even an engineering company. They are an operations company first and foremost. This trait is something you see throughout the cable industry because most people who work there came from support and operations and have little to no experience with engineering, architecture, and software projects. Because of the operations mentality the company has a very rigid culture of blame and shifting responsibility. When there is a problem, the first question is always not \"how do we fix it?\" but rather \"who can we blame for this?\" Additionally, because they are an operations-minded shop everyone is very resistive to change and it usually takes weeks to agree on anything or get anything done. Much of the management at this company make your average DBA look like a risk-taker.\r\nThe pay was crap, but I also know people who made good money there.

The most common deceptions used by outsourcers are \"Try it free for 30 days and if  you dont like it you can go back to your previous promotion\" and their previous package will be alot less money so since Retention is commission based as well we cant return them to their previous promotion without hurting our numbers and our own paychecks. The second most common deception used by outsourcers and sales agents is that they will tell customers \"Oh the package is $99.99 with everything\" but they wont tell them that on top of that theres a $10 modem rental fee, each additional tv box is $9.95, HD is an extra $10, DVR is an extra $10, and taxes are extra and guess who has to fix the mess when the customer gets their bill? retention department. \r\n\r\n- By the time the customer gets to speak to the retention department they already spoke to at least 2-3 other departments who couldnt help them and each time they were screened by previous agents for adding more lines of business then handed off to another department like a hot potato if they cant get any sale from the customer which causes frustration and angry customers by the time they finally get to retention.\r\n\r\n- To add a little more to my previous comment, retention agents are also responsible for adding lines of business but the customer is screened by previous agents that they spoke to before getting to retention to see if they can get any line of business sales from the customer so only the customers that they couldnt get a sale from get transferred to retention and retention then has to try to upsell those customers or give them the smallest discount possible if they dont want to add a line of business or disconnect them.\r\n\r\n- Many agents refuse to help a customer at all if their account has Xfinity Home (home security) because they dont understand the product enough to help the customer so they usually just transfer them to Xfinity Home Retention even if all they needed was help with billing questions or if they wanted to make changes to their other services that werent home security.\r\n\r\n- Retention is seen by other departments as the dumping ground to resolve customer issues even when a call isnt really a retention call, ive gotten billing agents that transfer accounts that are already disconnected (how is that a retention call?) to place some credits on the customers accounts because of billing errors but that waste my time because we only get commission on calls where the account is still active so thats time spent that you could be helping someone else who has an active account with the company.\r\n\r\n- When an outsource agent or sales agent adds a line of business that the customer didnt want or ask for to their account the retention agent is responsible for removing that line of business but if the customer never agreed to add the service or was never informed that the agent was adding that service to their account how is that fair to the customer and the retention agent who takes a hit on their numbers? the most common cases right now are agents adding home phone or the cheapest home alarm package ($20 a month) via self install kit and the customer calls when they receive the equipment in the mail to ask why they received the equipment for a service that they werent aware they were getting then its the retention agents job to sell the value of the product that they never asked for or take a hit for the service and remove it from the account.\r\n\r\n- Retention agents have to deal with sneaky people within the company sabotaging their retention efforts in order to get a sale for example its often the case where a sales person will create a new account in the new address where a customer moved to but that same sales person will then transfer the customer to retention department to disconnect the account at the previous address and not tell the retention agent that they created another account for the customer, the correct process is for the agent to transfer the account from the old address to the new one and disconnect the old account before connecting the new one but sometimes they dont disconnect the old account so that they dont have to spend more time with the customer on the line. This can affect the retention agents numbers because since the sales person didnt do their job properly if you dont know that the customer has two accounts you will disconnect an account that someone else was suposed to disconnect hurting your numbers. \r\n\r\n- Sometimes sales agents will collaborate with customers telling them that they should disconnect their account and then speak to them to create an account under their spouses name to get a new customer promotion so that they can get a sale which is unethical because their manipulating the system for personal gain at the expense of the company and other employees."]},

They provide many opportunities for advancement allowing their employees to enhance as well as maximize their abilities.", "Pay, compensation, benefits, team morale is great.", "Money, flexibility depending on your manager/sup, & free services."], "cons": ["First: In regards to the free cable and internet. Because you are an employee of Comcast and no longer considered a customer, any repair requests or changes that you may have, even if it's equipment related, which you are required to pay for can take several weeks to complete. Courtesy Services does not work quickly at all when it comes to employee repair issues.\r\n\r\nSecond: In regards to the job itself. I was hired for video repair. Now, I'm not idiot, so I assumed being a multiple service provider, some upselling and upgrading would probably be required, however, this is not the case. You don't find out until your SECOND day of employment (first day is orientation), which is your first official day of training that your primary goal is sales. It doesn't matter how mad the customer is, how many missed appointments they've had, or how many times they've flat out been lied to by other reps, you're still required to try to get a new line of service on them. An elderly lady calls you because her DTA ($1.99 basic cable box) doesn't work and says there's an interruption in service (more so than not, this means the box is bad and needs to be replaced), and while discussing the situation she happens to state she's on a limited income and can't afford a technician to come out and replace the box (free if it's the equipment, $39.95 if it's ANYTHING else), if you don't want it get scolded by management, you better try to sell her digital voice, or internet. She has a DTA? Better try to get her up to either a Digital set top box so she can get On Demand, or better yet, Just get her into an HD Triple Play package. I feel absolutely mislead about the job I interviewed and was eventually hired for. Had I known it was a driven primarily by sales, I never would have accepted the position in the first place.\r\n\r\nThird: Career Advance Path (or, how to keep you in one spot until you can be replaced by trainees, because they trainees will be paid $11.00 USD per hour starting and can be easily replaced). This path was setup as a way to \"promote\" from within based on how hard you want to work and prove your worth to the company. You have 6 months from your hire date to go from CAE: Level 1 Representative to CAE: Level 2 Associate. This comes with a $1.00 USD pay increase. The problem with this are the metrics involved. While you are required to meet four of the metrics for promotion, I will focus on the three that are almost impossible. The first is TSRs, those are your sales, but not just sales. They have to be new lines of service. That means if someone only has cable, you better sell them internet, or phone. If you can sell a triple play, then you get 2 TSRs. You have to meet a percentage of 0.58% (absolute bare minimum) of sales on all of your total calls. On average, you can take 600 or more calls per fiscal month. 0.58% doesn't sound like much at all, especially over the course of 600 or more calls, right? Well that's 34.8 new lines of service. Now 600 is a high number. That would be on a very high call volume month. More accurately, you're probably going to take between 400 and 500 calls, so the number of TSRs required will raise or drop based on the number of calls you take per week, per month.\r\n\r\nThe next metric that really matters is called VOC: Voice of the Customer. Ever call Comcast and while you're waiting for a rep, the recording asks you if they can call you back to take a brief survey about your experience? That's what VOC is to employees. By default, you start at 100% monthly. Now, if you can maintain 100% per month, that pretty much just means that out of all of your calls, everyone opted out of that survey, so there was nothing to bring it down. While this survey is meant to be a way of the customer to give their opinion as to how I the representative helped you, most look at it as a reflection of the company, and oddly enough, we have a running slogan at Comcast, \"No one is calling to tell you how happy they are with the service\" and that's the truth. Unless during the survey, when given the opportunity, the customer actually records a voice message stating the rep they spoke to did an amazing job, anything negative that they report about Comcast directly reflects on the rep themselves, even if we successfully helped you. The customer is never made aware of this.\r\n\r\nThe final metric I want to discuss is called FCR: First Call Resolution. What this means to the rep is as follows. Say you're a Comcast customer and you're having issues with your video (since I only worked in video) and you call in and select the video option and get me. I have two options at my disposal. First and foremost, I want to troubleshoot the problem, because in most situations, the problem can be resolved by sending a refresh signal to your defective box (unless you have a DTA with a blinking light. If that light is blinking, you need your box replaced 9 times out of 10). After sending the refresh signal, we will ask you to disconnect the power to your faulty box for about 20 to 30 seconds then plug it back in. After a reboot process from the box, in most circumstances, your services will be restored. If these steps do not work, we have on other option, we send a technician out to your house. Now, we will tell you that if the problem is with the equipment, the service call is free, and this is true, however, the technicians have quotas to meet as well and more so than not, a tech will tell you there is a wiring problem and tell you that you either need to add a Service Protection Plan (Insurance for your cable lines that runs between $3.95 USD and $4.95 USD per month based on whatever market you're in) to prevent you from having to pay the $39.95 USD technician fee. If you don't want that option, we can then tell you to return the faulty box to a local service center (expect about a two hour wait) to replace the equipment, but if you bring that box home and it doesn't work, guess what? You now have something called a Failed Self Install, and regardless of your protection plan, it will not cost you $39.95 USD to have the tech come out and fix it.\r\n\r\nAssume that I did fix your problem though, but you call back in 4 days later over a billing issue, if you either just hit 0 to talk to someone quickly in hopes of not waiting, you will get routed back to a repair department, if you happen to get video (we have a 7 day window before our FCRs are considered good and we're credited for them), but tell me on the phone that you need to get to billing. Through no fault of your own, other than wanting a rep quickly, you just caused me to get a negative mark on my FCR, simply because you came through on the video queue instead of going through the billing queue. Then, as an added bonus, I'm slapped with a negative transfer rate, because we're not supposed to transfer calls. When you combine just these three of the four metrics that we are required to meet for advancement to level 2 (you're terminated after six months if you've not attained three consecutive months of meeting and exceeding the four primary metrics. UNLESS of course, you have good sales and don't really do anything else. Then they're more than happy to break that rule for you and keep you on the phones with the promise of having you restart the Career Advance Path again for another six months.\r\n\r\nYour shifts are not determined by seniority either. They are determined by sales alone. Those with low sales work the worst shifts, which basically means there is no such thing as ever seeing your family again if you wish to stay employed in a Comcast call center. Also...those metrics have to be met in order for you to even transfer to another department like Com tech, or dispatch.\r\n\r\nONE MORE VERY IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE: If you are a Comcast customer reading this and you demand to speak to a supervisor, there are two things you should know.

I had such high-hopes at the beginning, expecting this to be a company which would want to develop, grow and empower its employees to reach their individual potentials. Sadly, this is not the case. There is no mentoring and there are no career paths. Management does not recognize the talents and gifting of its employees so they are rarely utilized. Everyone sitting in cubicles is under-utilized talent who are capable of so much more, but management is uninterested in encouraging personal development. \r\n\r\nAs for the corporate culture, this took a drastic turn after the purchase of NBC Universal. Prior to purchasing NBCU, there are a fair amount of autonomy at individual locations and business practices had some flexibility to better serve the needs of customers. After purchasing NBCU, Comcast became overtly political and is now a company dominated by cultural relevance. Business practices are now top-down, one-size-fits all. The problem is, NOTHING is one-size-fits all and the customers suffer because of this. As an employee you will be exposed to, overwhelmed with and bullied by all of the cultural \"social justice\" issues of the day. \r\n\r\nWorking at Comcast will not give you a personal sense of worth nor will it give you hope for your future. You will go to work each day and perform some tasks within a functional group however value will not be added to your life. The best you can hope for is to be blessed by a few personal relationships you are able to develop with some of your co-workers. This is what will sustain you. Over the last 4-5 yrs of my career at Comcast, my annual \"performance increases\" were a measly 2%. And I say \"performance increases\" because my annual reviews had nothing to do with my actual performance. Annual salary increases are determined during the annual budgeting process and understand that this company is ALWAYS looking for costs to cut. Costs associated with employees are always the first cuts made. Each year after the budget process is completed in Q3, headcount cuts are made in Q4. I was a witness to this the past 5-8 years.\r\n\r\nIf you seek \"job security\" then you will likely be able to find that at Comcast as long as you have no dreams or career aspirations. If you are someone who wants to make a difference or you want your hard work to be appreciated and rewarded then Comcast is not the place for you.

Computers track in real time not just for your immediate supervisor but across the call center how long you are on a call with every single customer (if you go over a certain time while helping a customer and your supervisor arbitrarily decides today is the day to crack down on that you will receive an IM about it in real time to get off). Your breaks thus are logged and monitored in real time down to the second. The calls are back-to-back from the time of your first phone call to the last. There are people who do not believe there are such Orwellian jobs or technology yet where an employee's \"productivity\" can be monitored in real time by the second and acted on, but anyone in service-industry type jobs just above the fast-food level or big-box-store level knows this is very much the reality (warehouse employees for online sellers, for example, also are tracked for their productivity from the moment they electronically check in through every single item they scan and package and how many seconds it takes them to reach another bin, etc.). All of this is before you even get to the ridiculous quotas, also monitored and tracked in real time electronically, but many other posters already have hit on that. Your corporate identity is 100 percent numbers 100 percent of the time. But at least it's a job.\r\n\r\nThe single most frustrating thing is that Comcast issues deliberately contradictory pricing information to call center employees and that it provides a single day of training on troubleshooting and resolving issues that 99 percent of customers calling into the call center are trying to resolve (one day out of two months of training is devoted to troubleshooting; the rest is devoted to sales). The contradictory pricing information and constantly changing basic Comcast corporate policies are not just bad communications -- they are deliberate. The contradictory information means that any given customer calling in will get a different answer on pricing from every single person he/she speaks to, and it's totally a crapshoot whether the person seeking help with the service will actually have the issue resolved. The contradictory information often flies in the face of what even the supervisors of the front-line call center employees might have repeatedly said is the policy over the course of a year -- literally overnight front-line call center employees and their supervisors will learn that what they've been doing all along to follow the rules and keep their jobs isn't just a little bit different than what the corporate policy really is but 100 percent the opposite, and a bunch of coworkers in one fell swoop in one day will be fired to underscore the seriousness of their infraction. I don't know why upper management operates in such a way -- there will always be a few longtime devoted great employees caught in the mass firings -- but it almost has to be budgetary (the call center needs to make its own quotas) and arbitrarily overnight changing policies and saying that's been the policy all along allow the company to cite a reason for an abrupt mass firing. The employees really are just endless set of numbers and mathematical calculations on a computer screen. \r\n\r\nSo. Welcome to Comcast.", "Lot of baggage in terms of culture.

A couple of examples: Customer Service agents have their phone calls monitored for time and count. Supervisors look at these (among other) numbers to determine if employee is meeting the days numbers. No where does it record if problems are actually solved. WAY too often the agents rushes people off the phone without correcting a problem that would have taken them beyond the expected time limit. This infuriates customers as anyone who has Comcast can attest. The agents who take the time to make sure the problems are corrected go over the limit, don't get as many calls completed and, without recourse, get denied a raise.\r\nThe Technicians have it much the same way. A tech is given an average of 60 minutes to go to a house, identify the problem and correct it. Oh yes, and check everything else in the house to make sure the customer does not have to call again for a repeat trouble call. In a new construction home, this is fine. In a 50 year old home with old wires that need replacing, the job could take four hours. Do it right.....no raise. Do it fast, customer calls back and the Tech gets a repeat....no raise.\r\nComcast recently had many long time employees in Customer Care ( many supervisors) have to re-apply for their jobs. Many did not get re-hired. The environment is one that, even most supervisors, feel that every day could be their last. It is an extremely stressful job at every level. A few years ago the numbers guy in our office actually asked the technicians how long it took to walk from their morning meetings to their trucks.

The companies sales process is so extremely dysfunctional that it takes hours and hours out of your day instead of selling.  This truly creates a 60-70 hour work week.  On top of that, the front end sales numbers (I.e., prospecting and cold calling) is enormous (25 initial appointments per month with clients you have never met with before).  This is Enterprise also, so the MAJORITY of people you contact would not have a need for Enterprise-level products.  Management is high pressure and in my experience uses bullying tactics and fear mongering in order for people to work harder.\r\n\r\nThe reality is in the numbers.  When I was there (18 month tenure), there was only around 4-5 out of 27 reps that were at quota (!!!).  That is a terribly low number of reps making quota, considering that the sales force is comprised of very smart people, most of whom has 10++ years of sales experience.  Simply not acceptable.\r\n\r\nComcast is so huge that they lost their eyes completely on customer service.  They create issues with their horrific\\bizarre\\dysfunctional sales process and stick their customers in the middle of it.  Guess who gets the calls?

This ends up creating more issues for the reps, more time, and more difficulty trying to attain the high sales metrics.", "Willful OSHA violations - we were told in writing we should never use \"personal,\" time to use the restroom and that's what our breaks were for, violating OSHA 1910.141(c)(1)(i) \r\n\r\nScrutiny for try to take care of the customer - if it was necessary to call a customer back for any reason, and the callback lasted more than 10 minutes you may have people coming to ask why you are not \"available,\" or getting emails the next day asking you to explain why your total \"outbound,\" time for the day exceeded their goal.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe company stopped putting any faith into troubleshooting abilities of their agents and mandated use of a line-of-questioning as the only way we were allowed to help customers. Essentially you become an interactive script and even if you can see in your notes or diagnostics what the customer's issue is, you are not allowed to simply take the proper step to fix it, you must ask the customer irrelevant questions and fill out the ticket. You are no longer able to even send a simple refresh signal to a piece of equipment without \"permission,\" from their line-of-questions system. This system was full of bugs and feedback and bug-reporting were ignored for months at a time, only then to receive a stock reply of \"we are working on it,\" or the ticket being rejected as a \"duplicate,\" but with no resolution. Despite the amount of time you were forced to waste in this system, the metric of how long you can have a customer on the phone for was never adjusted to compensate.\r\n\r\nThe system essentially nullified any need for training as anything you learned in training was no longer useful - you could only say and do what was on your screen. You essentially become an automated system with slightly better voice recognition. I truly believe the overall goal of this is to reduce training costs. Before this system, new agents spent six weeks in training. Comcast call centers have a huge turnover rate, so the cost of training is fairly significant. Eliminating the need for training, even at the cost of a far, far, inferior customer experience seems to be preferable. This will make employees more expendable and help with costs related to the turnover rate. No competent person stays at Comcast long because the pay is not worth the environment and the way you are treated. I think it's very sad Comcast thinks this is a better solution than fixing the things that make people quit and hiring competent people who can troubleshoot effectively without literally being told what to do, step-by-step, real-time.\r\n\r\nWhile paid time off seemed generous, the fact that an unscheduled absence for *any reason,* was considered \"unacceptable,\" offset that significantly. T-Boned on your lunchbreak? Unacceptable; point. Death of a close family member who does not meet their strict criteria of \"immediate?\" Unacceptable; point for any time missed as a result. They give you what they call \"flex-waives,\" which, in reality, are what other companies call \"personal days.\" The difference is they are used as excuses to not waive any absence for any reason beyond those 4 \"flex-waives, regardless of what documentation and you may have and regardless of the situation.\r\n\r\nIt is normal to take the unfavored shift when starting with an employer, but at Comcast, I was stuck with it. 1-Midnight, including weekends. Despite the fact that their was a shift bid 5 months after we started, we were not allowed to participate. My numbers were good and I looked forward to getting a more manageable shift. They were using 3 months of scorecard data to calculate rank. While we had 3 months of data, the range they defined included one month for which we were not on the phone. It would have been very easy to slide that date range to let us participate in the bid. There were a number of ways to let us participate, but they chose not too. Seniority is only 30% of the bid, it is supposed to be based on performance  but despite being a top-performer I was stuck for a year working 1pm-Midnight because it was easier for them logistically.\r\n\r\nBenefits were quite expensive compared to other Fortune 500s and for slightly worse coverage.\r\n\r\nMany promised benefits were not possible to take advantage of.

My 8 months of back breaking labor doesn't matter to them. And their excuse for the 2 months after was \"new hires that start in October are not eligible for a merit raise\" ... Yes, I am aware of this. It is true because they are within a 90 day new hire trial period, so no they wouldn't get a merit raise for that calendar year. BUT I'M NOT A NEW HIRE! I\u2019m a rehire, and I did work during the calendar year and I was NOT in a 90 trial period. How convenient you relabeled me just in this regard so as to not have to give me my well DESERVED and most certainly earned raise.  Screwed me over is what you did. I'm sure all your employees with poor work ethic still got their raise. I owe the company at least 10 months of lack of effort, but it\u2019s not my way, I just have too good of work ethic. I just need to be with a company that truly honors that and wants to retain the good employees. My raises have been anywhere from 4%-6.5%, (5% being the max we were told) I\u2019m really that great of a worker. My entire management team gave me glowing letters of recommendation because they wanted to make sure the company retained me. And then the company slaps me in the face, again.

Comcast is filled with people doing heavy lifting, bending, twisting, back hurting jobs, whether a tech, a warehouse employee, or someone sitting at a desk for 8 hours, real chiro care would be great but sadly we only get 12 visits. If you are unlucky enough to have to use any of those visits before you hit deductible you'll  be paying about $45 a visit, and then after you use up 12.. You\u2019ll be paying $45 a visit\u2026 So try to hit deductible before you need chiro-care.  \r\nAnother con is, sometimes management doesn't want to deal with, handle, manage, the troublemaker employees. Maybe they are scared to? But sometimes some management will make a martyr out of a good employee because they don't want to reprimand a bad one. It's sad, I\u2019ve seen it a lot unfortunately. \r\nIn the office setting there is a very clich\u00e9 \"clique\" scene. I came from warehouse, and get some grief for having not been with in this building before getting hired in this position. As if I am any less capable of doing this job. And honestly, I do it better already than some of the old timers here who have gotten to the point of laziness and lack of care. \r\nAfter your 5th year you will not receive any more extra vacation time. Sad, I know lots of people who've been here for 20 years and get nothing for it, not even a real raise because they are \"capped\" I think they get a onetime bonus each year for time served. \r\nSpeaking bonuses, they gave us all $1000 bonus after they got a HUGE tax break from Trump. That bonus was taxed so hard, that the government still got theirs, and Comcast got to save on theirs, and i didn't get a raise, and that lousy $450 bucks was pointless and did NOTHING to help the employees or the economy in which we live. Thanks for nothing on that front. Didn't even cover half of rent. \r\n\r\nMost of the places won't let you use your flex time as needed. It's your time and you get punished constantly for having to use it, Vacation should be scheduled, Flex should be able to use freely *within reason*. We fought for that at the warehouse and got it but now my new position is a big NOPE. All my work is finished for the day, even if there is plenty of coverage and we're all twiddling our thumbs, if you have to leave early, you're getting punished. Forget to log into the phone after lunch, get punished. Come in 3 minutes late, punished. I could have just gone to Tim Hortons, grabbed breakfast, been 2.5 hours late, and had the same punishment. I'll remember that next time if traffic is stupid and I\u2019m not going to make it within that 1 minute 59 second grace period. \r\nIt doesn't matter if you work through my breaks, I stay late if its needed,  go above and beyond, get all of your work done, help others theirs done, you get punished right and left for using flex time, OUR TIME, without a 24 hour notice. Heck, I came into work and at 9am I asked to take the next day off because something came up last minute, (my shift starts at 8:30 mind you) the 23.5 hour notice wasn't a 24 hour notice.. I got punished. I needed to take a weekend off, but felt bad because of the already light coverage and didn't want the other ladies to be swamped, so I chose to come in for a couple hours anyways to help out. Had an issue in the morning, got there late, stayed later to make sure all the things were done, and got punished. Next time I\u2019ll just take the whole day and not try to be nice. It only bit me in the behind in the long run. This is definitely getting old.\r\nI'm giving Career Opportunities a 1 star, because you could be perfectly qualified for a job and get denied without reason, and then the job will go back up on the board as open. Come to find out, I have been told multiple times \u201cwe don\u2019t hire outside the building, you are a rare case\u201d Why don\u2019t you hire outside the building? Is this how all the establishments with in Comcast operate? How do we move up if all you see is Warehouse, or Driver and immediately assume we\u2019re too stupid or unskilled. I\u2019ve seen it happen too many, they get stuck in these entry level positions and it actually HURTS them. You think you are getting a foot in the door, but really you are getting stuck in the room. \r\nThe ONLY reason I was even considered was because of being a great employee, and the right connection seeing it firsthand put a word in for me. They have this mentality of \u201cif you didn\u2019t start in this office there\u2019s no way you could do this job\u201d. Let\u2019s be clear, this job is EASY. At least for myself it is, I see people who\u2019ve been here for 20 years struggle with concepts or not catch on as fast to new content as I have. I have BFA, I am computer/tech savvy, I can learn any new software or program within a week or 2. I have common sense, and logic. I have experience in this kind of work. I\u2019m smart, motivated, self-managed, and a shining example of good work ethic.  But I was almost not even given the time of day because I wasn\u2019t with in this building?

The metrics you have to meet to move up have become very high as well plus your supervisor has to like you enough to feel you are ready to move up. They are still in the business of rushing their technicians to make time frames and have high production with \"good\" quality which leads to a lot of skipped breaks and sometimes even a half lunch if we get one at all. If you do work there, gain the favor of the boss and just mimic what they do if they were a technician even if it is not with the best interest of the customer. Its about finishing out jobs quickly here, not so much customer satisfaction.You don't have days off as well since if someone calls in on you for whatever reason, even if not cable related, you get a bad mark on your metrics therefore making it harder for you to move up. They claim they do not count it against you, if it is not workmanship, but they do. This makes it harder for you to make your metrics and in turn harder to get paid more. When you reach your higher amount of money as a technician you have to befriend management to keep your job long enough to get fired before retirement which I have seen them do to older technicians. Tech's are just numbers to them, literally. We have technician numbers with metrics beside them. The technicians that I have heard of that did that were actually good were let go for whatever reason they may have seen fit. Good tech's, good people. Just not up to the speed of what the company wanted. If you look up Comcast under Forbes, they are the worst known for customer satisfaction in 2014 and being a tech there, I can see why unfortunately. Everyone in the middle are less stressed, but underpaid for the work they do so if they are ok with the smaller pay then it is a little more stressful than the worst or the best technicians. Management looks at the poor customer satisfaction and lack of quality work done on the first visit as \"job security\". Not really customer driven at all unless a customer complains, especially on You Tube. I only stay here because the money is good enough, but the customer loyalty and the opportunity for growth for good tech's are lacking. This is a high stress job when you are doing really good and when you are doing bad.

From installers, office workers, coders, and support staff Comcast will always bring on an army of contractors before they will even consider a full time hire.

This explains why Comcast  consistently ranks on the bottom of JD Power customer service rankings for telecom providers.\r\nAlso, most of Comcast's training is via Comcast University which is done online by the employee.

Nothing special here.", "Loose corporate structures can lead to sloppy management and political squabbles.", "Aggressive sales goals, when softly concerns were raised no resolution was reached", "Appearance of function is often more important than actual function, both internally and externally.  Statistics are fairly easily manipulated if you know how.\r\n\r\nToo often localized management displays rather short term business behaviors in trying to shine for upper local or centralized senior corporate leadership (Philly). Those in higher positions of power often have little idea of how things really work locally and on the front line, but think they do and those under them are often either ignorant themselves or simply to scared to correct them, resulting in the implementation of negatively impacting policies as a result. Even if local or senior leadership do confer with local or front line employees they rarely listen and typically move forward with their ideas, or those of their superiors, regardless. It's hard to say if this is out of arrogance or a mistrust that the employees aren't being honest with them. Speaking up about such issues is often ignored outright or can result in someone being labeled a bad employee, even so far as being targeted to get rid of (and HR will often not have your back in such a case since it's that persons superiors who have their ear).\r\n\r\nInternal policy often drives negative employee behavior. Front line employees are often given conflicting goals. For example, in tech support our employee reviews are negatively impacted if we send a technician to a customers home as compared to correcting the issue over the phone, providing us with a reason to not help customers that need in-person support requiring a truck roll.  Tech support reps often find ways to get the customer to call back rather than schedule an in-person service call in order to pass the known needed truck roll on to another tech support agent.  This is one of the various reasons customers have to call multiple times to get the help they need.\r\n\r\nOutsourcing aspects of the service, sometimes even internal support, is causing problems that are being ignored too long for the sake of saving money on paper or, if money is actually being saved, it's only in the short term. Customer service suffers for the sake of saving a little money and in the long run money will be lost due to bad customer service.  With the increase in cell phone usage and the advent of internet based entertainment this will become a bigger liability in the near future.\r\n\r\nBenefits, while still good, have been getting reduced over the years. Higher end medical plan options have repeatedly been done away with over the years and 401k match dropped a several years back. Yet Comcast makes higher (record) profits every single year. Perhaps this is why?\r\n\r\nYou need to be a Yes-Man in order to move up. Even if your criticisms are legitimate there's rarely any point to voicing them. While middle management is somewhat to blame for this it can be argued the reason they don't try is because they are often stuck in the same situation with their local superiors. In most chains of command at Comcast you'll often run into someone who is afraid to rock the boat for the greater good of the company due to the fear of drawing attention to the fact that things aren't quite as rosy as people been painting them to be. As a result you will likely draw the, often silent, ire of your superiors by speaking up.\r\n\r\nSurprisingly, for one of the worlds largest communications companies in the world, Comcast needs to update their measuring stick for how the company is gauged.

Why not cut out all the small talk and go slower during training? Different trainers have different capabilities. some are better than others, so it's the luck of the draw who you get for your 8 weeks of training. There is ultra strict time-keeping... in training we learned the penalties for being even a minute late. Everything needs to be clocked, even going to the restroom. Plus the calls get monitored secretly, so you never know when you're being evaluated. There were hires that seemed to lack education, and their grammar in speaking was not good. This was surprising to me. As a customer, when I call into a call center, when a person can't use the English language appropriately, I'm uncomfortable with their degree of expertise about the product. The training facility rooms need improvement. Broken chairs that squeek LOUDLY every time you move, slow computers, only one screen to learn on when in fact the whole job relies on 2 computer screens. A lot of time is lost going back and forth between programs during training, losing information and time continually, adding to the stress and frustration. One trainer seemed much better than the one I had... I wasn't able to learn well with the trainer I was assigned. The whole training and job itself is very very regimented, so a person will have to learn to be compulsive in that way. I decided not to stay with the company eventually, because my strengths were not used working in a call center on the phone. My experience and past success has to do with person to person inter-action in real life, and so I can understand why the pay and earnings are better than average. It's a job that not everyone wants to do. Being in a call center all day is not for me, but some people obviously like it and do well.", "Hard to move around within the company. High stress/demanding positions. Work life balance is always a little off", "Anything that could be considered that is not in pros worse of them being things like very outdated and unnecessarily  complex software programs and highest levels of management, trainers, and employees themselves have had to learn by trial and error, complete unpredictability regarding dates for beginning and completion of training period and a embarrassingly horribly managed payroll team - personally witnessed many employees get absolutely no pay for about 8 weeks due to selecting the company visa as a paycheck method instead of a personal checking account and a few who requested paper check only to find out 8weeksbdowm the road that they don't actually have that option available and no mailbox was established at the time so their paychecks simply didn't exist and management could only stutter and say wait until weekend to see if theres any changes and then a further wait due to having to individually process and submit claims in order to get any of the lost wages back there's so many more cons but ultimately I think it all comes down to it being a new location for Comcast and only a few very short weeks from employers from out of state to the upper management of new location prior to any additional positions opening, as well, as the main focus is a huge renovation on ceasing outsourced employees and the general notion that they want to be considered the #1 in customer service as well as the most competitive in the market in regards to employee satisfaction, that's a tall order when Tucson is one of the few call center capitals for a new call center run by  young adults(primarily) with no certifiable qualification that more often than not were entry level agents or 2-4year supervisors at other existing call centers in Tucson many of which have horrendous reputations (experience is a greater skill than many courses however it doesn't seem the most thought out ideas to me, and the big press release style announcements about the plans to hire 1300 employeeswithin the first year of operations that's  in addition to first 800 that were already employed at time of advertisement , and the key thing here is that within months they were realizing they had virtually 100% too many employed during the night shift (about 2-6 calls not per employee but throughout the entire center each night which was supposedly caused by outsourced center throttling amount of calls until their contract is up which took two weeks to find out and being the big company it is id expect some level of preparedness expectations or at least knowledge of a contract they established?!

Not because the the knowledge base was not there but the changed where they were going to place us, not once but 3 times in the 2 week training period. Some of the possible options I had no experience in but that didn't seem to matter. In the end it came full circle to the orginal area we interviewed for, all that stress and confession for nothing.\r\n2) transition was unorganized when walked to the floor still not knowing who our supervisor was, no one even knew where we where expected to sit. When finnally sat several times it was decided that it was a mistake. This went in for the entire week. Some of us left behind if the team was moved on their day off, finding no where to sit upon their return. This lead to us spread out randomly throughout the floor, not getting the help or attention needed as a new hire. This continued untill our supervisor was decided and moved to our finnal team.\r\n3) management and employees have a huge disconnect supervisor teach change in service to wow the customer, to better their reputation. Their rating is in the negative below zero rating among customers, they hired an outside company with a multi year plan to change it, spending millions in training, marketing, and branding.  I give them major props for this and there are some success and changes being made. Employees voice is being heard on some levels with positive results.  But supervisors don't hold themselves to what they teach, example- the policy told to employees is if customers asks to speak to your manager to tell customer it will be 24-48 hrs for a return call. You then email the info to your supervisor. It's common knowledge if asked supvisors do not return customers calls. That customer will call in again and justifiedly so  very upset and angry. Even more frustrating is when the agent gets scored by customer in s survey they get marked down for something prior out of their control. In a defense supervisors appear very over worked, always off floor away from their teams in meetings. They have no assistance with time consuming tasks that are not sensitive in nature, other call centers I worked have a team lead to do these tasks and assist with coaching, and driving the team. The supervisors need the tools to manage their time better, and get on board with what they teach to better the company.\r\n4) supervisors are not in touch with how to handle HR issues or proper technical conversation of OSHA privacy. What can and can not be said or asked.  I have experience myself or seen. \r\n\r\nA supervisor  tell an employee that the supervisor had a family member who is a nurse, they said the illness was not serious. Not sure why they needed leave.\r\n\r\nI employee returning from leave without a activated badge or system access, the supervisor told employee that those were not his job, proceeded to do nothing to assist.\r\n\r\nSeen myself many employees and I myself have experienced problems with Sidwyck, the company who handles many of our leave benefits. They are flat a horrid company making many mistakes, then will deny you for their mistakes. Lost faxes , changed policies midway, short time frames even with their mistakes. It seems they are hired to protect Comcast bottom line, not as a benefit. Comcast to my knowledge has never investigated the claims or even questioned why employee's have so many problem. Supervisors do nothing to assist. Many employees seem to get lost and either quit or get fired on a tectinal issue I believe probably no fault of theirs, either way they are gone.\r\n\r\nI was once coached  once just weeks out of training the entire session was spent showing me how much money I cost the supervisor pay check. If I had performed at the same level as the rest of team he would of made $x.xx but I dropped him to $x.xx . Then proceeded to explain how had he could get me fired. To forget HR and time lines. He would write me up everyday  1-2-3 strikes your out, gone in a week. He gave me a month, but in two weeks I was moved to another floor and department. He told me he was doing me a favor.

As a technician they expect you to be the end all be all to help customers with their issues. Unfortunately as a technician they also expect you to do the job of the call centers, the sales staff, the equipment repair department, I.T., accounts recievable (I.E. debt collectors), as well as general bad news delivery.

The communication level of this company is laughable.  I get at least a few calls a week from customers asking about a new product or promotion that they've seen commercials about or received a mailer about that none of us in the call center has even heard of.  The front-line representatives always seem to be the last to know about many things in this company.  Just a day or two ago, a couple of co-workers of mine and I were getting calls about one of the service centers being boarded up... none of us had any idea what was going on or why the store was closed.  A FULL day later, we get a hastily put together e-mail stating that the store was closed for business... then a day after that another email was sent with the date that the store would be reopening.  Really?  What am I supposed to tell my customer?  Make something up so that I can get them off of the phone within the 6 minutes we're allotted for each call before our \"numbers\" are affected?\r\n\r\nThe expectations and goals set by the higher-ups are ridiculous... and the crazy thing is that they wouldn't be completely ridiculous if we were provided with the correct tools to handle our customers.  But instead, Comcast just drops their front-line employees in a rowboat with no paddles, in the middle of the ocean.  We don't even have estimated time of resolution 98% of the time when an outage occurs.  And what takes the cake... in the past year or so, someone came up with the great idea of adding customer surveys that call the customer back after ending the call.. and these surveys make up part of the scorecard that grades your overall performance.  In theory, this would be a good idea... but when you don't provide your employees with the correct tools to assist your customers, it's a recipe for disaster.  Most of the people choose ratings on the survey based on how upset they are with Comcast.. not because their interaction with the representative was unsatisfactory.  But that doesn't matter... your score is in the toilet because Comcast can't get their act together.\r\n\r\nSupervisors don't want to take calls when a customer requests to speak with a supervisor... instead they halfway listen to you explain what the issue is and then tell you what to say to the customer.  WHAT?  You can only imagine the position this puts the representative in... you already have someone on the phone who no longer wants to speak with you, but NOW.. you have the audacity to not honor their simple request... and keep feeding them BS.  And don't DARE get sick without planning it 2 months in advance... every unplanned absence gets a write up.. whether you just didn't feel like coming in or you're in a car crash.

Many times, time off requests can be denied or you get put on waiting list.  Its amazing how often comcast outages occur on the network every day, very fragile system it seems. They put business customers services over  a very old residential infrastructure and the business network should have its own network instead of trying to buyout other companies they should pour the money into the network build out and make these outages go away. Its 2015 and as mature as cable is more than 30 years you would think they got this down pat and reliability.

Here, you will be required to check into the office everyday at 8AM but be out of the office before 9:30am to get in your car to drive back from where you came from (most salespeople live in the territory they cover). You will then go knock doors prospecting for business. At 3:00pm you are required to be back in the Berlin office to make phone calls till 5PM or submit orders, while the manager walks around to make sure people are making calls.\n\nAt 5PM, there is a mandatory team conference call that will last between 30-45 minutes where you will explain what you did that day, how many sales you got, new opportunities found, number of appointments you sat on that day, number of appointments the following day, and your forecast for tomorrow. If you make a sale and it happened to contain voice and data, but the client did not want TV, you will need to explain why you they did not get TV and vice versa.  If you sold a lower tier Internet speed, you will have to explain why it was not a 50Mbps or faster connection.  In some instances the manager will insist going back to the client together and try to convince the client to get all 3 services or to increase their speed, because you as the sales professional, clearly did not listen to their needs the first time.\n\nIf you leave before the call is over you will be labeled a \"non team player\", so hopefully you dont mind traffic. My commute was dificult, but not nearly as bad as the guy who lived in the springfield Massachusetts area (yes he had to be in the office twice everyday too...no exceptions)\n\nTuesdays and Thursdays you will have in person  huddles where they will teach you things such as top down selling, wedge statements, open ended questions, or practice role plays (great information if you have never had a sales job before).  After the huddle you will have a 1 on 1 with your manager or a ride day where he shadows you and tells you what you did right or wrong in a condescending tone.  In the event that you miss a team huddle for being sick or more than 5 minutes late, you will have to make it up later that week with the manager.\n\nOn any given day, there can be no more than 2 people off due to \"business needs\", this includes holidays such as day before thanksgiving, black friday, Christmas eve, day after christmas, new years eve and new years day among others.\n\nI worked there for 3 months and went through velocity training and finished my ramp period.  At the end of that time, my manager held a formal review and said that \"unfortunately it was not going to work out and that I did not have the attitude needed to be successful here\", so i was let go.  Part of me felt bad being rejected and all, but I was also happy knowing that I would not have to endure this horrible and demeaning sales culture any longer.\n\nHad I known before hand what this job was all about, I never would have accepted it.

What's worse is this is the worst communicating company I've ever worked for bar none.  So with this combination Comcast across the board spends a disproportionate amount of time and resources misfiring causing customer aggravation, constant employee churn, and they unnecessarily burn through resources and customers like they have them to spare. \r\n\r\nAs an employee it's ungodly frustrating to work for a company that has no interest in providing you (the employee) the tools and resources you need on a daily basis to create a positive experience for your internal and external customers.  I have to literally fight my employer (Comcast) DAILY to get what I need to service their customers.  Training is entirely inadequate for company employees.  This is the reason when you call Comcast it depends on who you get as to what kind of service quality you receive.  It's basically up to the person to train themselves, or don't.  Comcast doesn't care and they won't fire anyone for poor performance (no accountability).  That \u2026 and the fact that there are more contract workers here than there are actual company employees and the contract workers have zero accountability. \r\n\r\nThe further up the leadership chain you go, the more disconnected they are from what's going on at your level.

["Very high stress level environment, field technicians overworked, with unreasonable  expectations on metrics.", "N. - hours available", "Management aren't so good to deal", "Not many options for customers", "- Very tough metrics to achieve, in order to pass your scorecard and not get fired your expected to have a 40% general attachment rate which means for every 10 calls you receive you have to sell 4 services minimum to pass and you must have a 75% video attachment rate minimum as well so every time you sell a service you need to sell video along with it 3/4 of the time to pass your metrics and not get written up or fired which is extremely tough because almost everyone that will be calling in will be wanting to open an account with internet only and Comcast puts commercials saying they can get internet as low as $19.99 a month to get people to call in but you wont be able to pass your metrics if thats all you sell.\r\n\r\n- There are customers that will flat out refuse to add video service and will refuse your sales pitch no matter how much you explain about the benefits, tie it to their needs, explain the features, etc but Comcast will keep pushing you to make people get video to meet the 75% minimum video attachment rate if you want to pass your scorecard and not get written up or fired. \r\n\r\n- Supervisors and Managers will constantly be pushing you to sell triple play packages and quad play packages to customers who may only want 1-2 services.   \r\n\r\n- Not all the calls you receive are sales calls, only about 10% of the calls you receive are actual sales calls and the rest are people who dialed the wrong extention or just dialed any extension in the automated system to get to a live person when they were trying to reach a department like billing, tech support, or the disconnections department but here they are speaking to the sales department and each call you receive that you dont sell anything lowers your attachment rate (even if its not a sales call) so good luck making that 40% general attachment rate to pass scorecard.\r\n\r\n- Alot of people will call in just to ask for information about promotions or prices but have no intention of buying anything on the call and if you try to close the sale with them they will say things like \"I have to talk to my spouse before making a decision\", you offer to call their spouse and they will say that their not available, you offer to call them back at a later time and they wont pick up their phone at the time they agreed for you to call them back 99% of the time.\r\n\r\n- On top of the attachment rate goals there are also other metrics you have to meet to pass scorecard like revenue per call, total revenue sold, amount of security systems sold (need 2 minimum monthly to pass), Quality Analysts score (how good you follow a script), and their talking about adding more things to the scorecard as well.\r\n\r\n- If your not meeting your sales goals you will be constantly harassed every day you come into work by your supervisor and their manager asking what your doing to improve your numbers, trying to get you to compete against other agents, hinting that if you dont improve your sales you may be written up, put on a performance improvement plan that prevents you from switching to another department that might be a better fit for you, and letting you know every day that being on a performance improvement plan is 1 step away from getting fired, etc.\r\n\r\n- The Comcast commercials are deceptive because they advertise that you can get $19.99 internet but its really $24.99 and you receive a $5 discount if you sign up for automatic payments and bills via email if not you pay $24.99 and Comcast advertises that it \"comes with 5 lines of mobile already included\" but each mobile line is $45 a month for unlimited data or $12 per each GB of data (which is said in the small letters in the commercial that people dont read).\r\n\r\n- You have to constantly follow up on your orders to make sure nobody cancelled your sales order and re-entered it with their sales id because you only have 3 days to dispute it after the installation completes if not the person who stole your sale gets the credit for it.\r\n\r\n- 90 day chargebacks on your sales if the customer disconnects for any reason even if their moving to a new location within 90 days or if they installed in one address and then changed their apartment number or address within 90 days.\r\n\r\n- Sales department works all holidays\r\n\r\n- The script you have to follow is constantly changing and the Quality Analysts deduct points for petty things and knit pick your calls so that nobody has a perfect score.\r\n\r\n- The company is always changing and restructuring, I used to work in National Bilingual Retention for several years and then one day all of a sudden the company director comes in and tells everyone in the call center to go to a room for a meeting to make an announcement and they tell us that Spanish Retention is getting outsourced to Mexico, English Retention is going to be based out of Jacksonville,  FL and the Philippines, and that our call center is getting converted to Regional Spanish only Sales which I thought wasnt so bad at first because I wouldnt have to deal with irate customers anymore from Bilingual Retention until I actually started working in Spanish only Sales and saw all the unrealistic sales goals they have to pass the scorecard and all the things agents have to deal with to make the company happy.\r\n\r\n- Commission isnt what it used to be, I used to make better money working in National Bilingual Retention than I do now working as a Regional Spanish only Sales agent. \r\n\r\n- Lack of positions to move to, I tried seeing if maybe there was another department that I could transfer to since im not happy in Spanish only sales but the company barely posts job openings for internal employees that want to switch departments, they would rather hire new people from outside to fill positions. \r\n\r\n- Comcast used to raffle out big prizes for selling like 50+ inch LED TV's, Xbox, Playstation, ipads, etc but that all stopped once our center became Spanish only Sales.", "No cons at all .", "Nothing to speak of really", "Long working hours per day.", "Money not worth work", "Nothing nothing more important

Every supervisor who actually cared about their team and questioned the horrible decisions made by upper management were either fired or their jobs become a living hell due to the aforementioned retaliatory actions.

Customer assistance fell by the wayside when we would no longer support half the equipment that we provided subscribers (ie routers, gateway systems and phone products). The same time the training for the job was getting less and less for any new products, it would get so bad that you would be asked by the customer how a certain new product worked and it would be something that you hadn't even heard about. When training was offered it was months after the fact, and rushed also to get a whole days training into a 45 min session. Last year my former tech support department was dissolved locally and moved to a different city so I was offered to reskill to stay local or commute. I reskilled, the reskill training was no better, anyone coming from tech department to the retention department previously would go throught a 6 week training program going over all types of things, we were given a week training and most of the time it was making posters and different signs not doing any real sales training or anything really pertinent to the job. After this for about 2 months I was sat with a supervisor that did nothing to help me to transition to this new position that I feel was forced on me. All around me people who know their job are being replaced by people who do not, and are giving out false and incorrect information.  Now I am being told that the new people off the street are getting the sales training that was denied to me and others. Wouldn't it make sence to invest in your long time employees since they know the products like the back of thier hand. My voice of the customer rating is constistently at or around 100% and that means absolutely nothing now since now matter how happy they are with me if I dont sell them something else on top of what they have then I get knocked down regardless. If someone calls in now to lower ther bill and you are able to keep the services they have and RETAIN them as a customer it still means nothing since you didn't up their bill with another service that they don't want. Most people who get on my phone called a few days before and were charged something that they don't need or want to get a rep's commision higher and then I have to remove it to keep a customer or they will cancel. So at that point my stats go down lower so I can maintain my own ethical morals to help someone. I am currently looking for another place of employment so that I am not forced to undermine my own credibility by continually lying to the customer about not being able to help them save moeny when I see a lower price but giving this to them means cutting my nose off. To top it off with my seniority at the company my pay rate was cut down from around 18$ to 12$ so that I could stay local in a new department and seniority here means next to nothing anymore since restructuring the more sales you push the more say you have, leaving me and others like me just wallowing in the shadows.", "None I can think of.", "negative outlook from the general public", "Not a values-based organization, very political and hierarchical, people gun for you, meetings 8am-6pm = normal, always chasing approvals/zero autonomy, desperately wants to be a cool company but very conservative at its core", "No California West Division- moved out of state", "Politics of office!

I was told by a recruiter that based on my education, my base pay would be a bit higher. A whopping 75 cents higher.  Considering all the call center reps deal with, the long hours and the pathetic attendance policy, you\u2019d think they would at least pay their employees a minimum of $18/hr to start. They\u2019re a well known company, I think you can afford to pay your employees better than that. They try to sucker you in with the idea of \u201cmonthly incentives\u201d and \u201csales goals\u201d to help raise your pay, but it\u2019s the most minuscule amount they could possibly give you.

If you miss 51%-100% of your shift you receive 1 UAP. 3 UAPs total and you are fired (if you don\u2019t have any vacation/flex/float time). It\u2019s unrealistic to hold employees to this standard. Life happens, and this company needs to be aware of that.\r\n\r\n*Hours are ridiculous - You can either work 5 8 hours shifts or 4 10 hour shift. Saturdays are mandatory no matter what you choose. A call center should be open during regular business hours. There\u2019s no need to be open past 5:00 pm, let alone on a Saturday. \r\n\r\n*Training is extensive and over the top - They put you through 6 weeks of training that consists of videos, readings, quizzes and practicing calls. Which doesn\u2019t help you retain any information at all. It\u2019s basically like you\u2019re in school for 8 hours a day. They throw all of this information at you and expect you to remember every last detail about all of their services. Then have the nerve to tell you, \u201cdon\u2019t get used to it because these will probably change in 6 months.\u201d\r\n\r\n*Leaders give you the run around when it comes to asking for help - Asked a trainer a question regarding benefits information, she told me to reach out to a supervisor. So, I asked two of the supervisors (via email) for help. Both ignored me. Tried again with supervisor A and she told me to ask a peer to help me.

You're told to promise customers the moon to get them to sign a contract and tell them they can call you if they have any problems. When they do inevitably have problems, the company won't help the customer. The customer calls you for help. As their sales person, you call the customer service on their behalf to find that they won't help you either! You're usually referred back to your manager who is busy selling himself, and has no interest at all in helping your customer. Worse than that, my manager would say it was taken care of - which I would pass on to the customer, and then nothing would change. \r\n\r\nThe net effect is that you look like a big liar. You tell your customer you're taking care of their issues, and then it doesn't happen even though you've gone through all the proper channels --- over, and over and over.

Makes it difficult to change this situation even when it is obviously burdensome to employees.\r\n\r\n- Acts like they are promoting a fair and friendly workplace during the hiring process, but treats you like you are a grunt in the army after they hire you. There is no real management structure and anyone with a position can tell you what to do with little or no repercussions. The bad part of them hiring veterans is Comcasts encourages them to continue like they are in the military, treating employees as if they should have no life whatsoever, except what they are told to do.\r\n\r\n- Deceiving promotion of \"life to work balance\" and available overtime. What they don't tell you is you will be forced to do overtime whenever they feel like it. That overtime is not by CHOICE, it is by force - and therefore is not a \"benefit\", but they promote it as if it is.\r\n\r\n- Pay is cheap, especially for the work that is required of you, and the pay raises are minuscule at best. They call you a tech, but pay you peanuts and want you to thank them for it.\r\n\r\n- They promote employee fairness on one hand, but on the other treat certain classes like they aren't included. CommTechs, for example are routinely scapegoated, slammed with too many assignments, treated and disrespected by managers as their leisure. Nobody listens to them even though they are the people on the scene and their work process is constantly being overstuffed with anyone's \"ideas\", detrimental or not without any form of compensation or time relief. For the lower classes of workers there is no employee empowerment, despite Comcast edicts that constantly speak of it as if there is. Employees are weak and abuse is rampant.\r\n\r\n-Management is not required to know the skills of the people they are managing, creating a \"personality\" atmosphere where an employee gets by by learning how to appease an incompetent boss. There is also a lot of abuse and upper management doesn't seem to be concerned.\r\n\r\n-Insane work pace (which includes an undisclosed requirement to spend hours after your \"official\" work time). A system where those who are assigning jobs can abuse the ones who are working them - for example sending you to a job 60 miles away from the last one; or sending you to a job that will take 4-5 hours at the last hour of your shift (and Comcast forces you to do it, although they could either send someone else or find a solution that wouldn't negatively impact employees). They send Techs to two jobs per hour, and if you finish them they expect you to ask for more - like a monkey on a string. Note that just activating a new modem or box can take 20 minutes or more! You can cancel a job - but Comcast punishes you by de-marking you in their abusive metric system, that punishes people more the lower their job title is in the company.\r\n\r\n-Metric system - yes, their metric system is nothing more than a punishment device. What happens is you are given an impossible task, and if you cannot complete it a certain way you get negative points, which can negatively affect your measly salary. (Note that AT&T pays almost twice as much for the same position - despite having their own issues). Your process is constantly getting \"updated\", added to and delays to your strategy are added, with no adjustment to this system whatsoever. They act as though adding an hour extra to your hourly workload has no impact... which leads us to:\r\n\r\n- Employees cutting corners. Employees do not follow safety regulations. Not at all. Not even a little bit. The company doesn't actually help them either, unless you call Supervisors who know nothing showing up and yelling at you because your little cone isn't out \"helping\"... Your equipment broke? Wait... wait... wait some more. Maybe there is a used belt somewhere they can find for you. Employees are supposed to be trained in safety and several disciplines - but their training is not taken seriously. They rush people through it and throw them in the field. They do not help the employee get experience but ASSUME they do. They set you up with a regular employee for a few weeks and ASSUME they are teaching you - but those workers are either not interested, under-skilled or could care less about you learning anything. The other assumption is that since these people are out in the field (slave terminology?) that they will run into all of the jobs they need to learn what they are required to learn - WRONG AGAIN. The training is handled like a lottery, betting on trainees getting every type of job they need to learn - but in actuality since there is no program when a trainee is in the field, you just become some Tech's side-kick, and there is no guarantee your needed assignment will ever come up. Guess who gets the blame for that? THE TRAINEE. You should have \"asked\" your trainer to teach you something that you have no idea that you should have know... its your fault, because you know - you helped put the training program together...So after the training phase is over your out in the field trying to figure it out by yourself, which is why so many Techs are breaking every OSHA regulation and risking their lives every day. When these employees are called out, it becomes \"Their fault\", management takes no responsibility for creating an abusive working atmosphere that breeds this kind of response. Over half of the jobs are repeats, but management doesn't seem to learn that crushing people in an unreasonable work pace, under threat of discipline is not efficient. It makes people rush through a job and make it \"look\" like it is done - just for the metrics. he fact is, when a tech knows that their shift is about over, they try like hell to not get stuck with one of those forced overtime situations - and who can blame them?\r\n\r\n- Wasted resources in a worker resource that nobody cares about, and has possible leaks. They tell you about this way to improve the company - go to comcastnow.com and submit an \"anonymous\" report. Next thing you know your getting some kind of punishment. It would be nice if they took it seriously , but employees are mostly afraid to say anything because they do not trust it.\r\n\r\n- Forced waiting periods in the promotion or lateral movement. They act like your locked in after you get hired. No matter how talented you are they tell you to wait for a year (or 6 months, or 3 months depending on who you ask) before you can move to another position. Say you want to work in Comcast Business - if you didn't get directly hired in that position in the first place you will have to wait a year - for no reason whatsoever. They will say they want you to have \"experience\" in another position - but if that's the case why does someone else walk off the street and get that position? Also, Supervisors can stop you from being promoted with little or no reason - like whether they like you personally or not.\r\n\r\n- Management has the attitude that people who haven't been promoted must not want to. It isn't like they ask people, they just assume that is the case and just leave people to burn. They even say this fondly as if those people are happy scratching out cheap pay and getting blamed for all Comcast's problems. The also act like new hires are getting some kind of welfare, as if they should all kiss Comcast's backside because Comcast is doing all this for them. Forget about qualifying with a resume, experience and evaluations - you just rolled up off the street and Comcast \"gave you\" this welfare benefit.", "The entire company is linked. You can't complain to HR with them going behind your back.  It's a lot of white privilege.  They will make your job hard if you speak up about it.  And they offer surveys but the survey is linked to your bonus,  If you give management a bad review, it will affect you."]},

The agents I worked with really cared about getting customers' equipment/services working, but Comcast corporate does not share that same outlook.  Comcast pushes their repair agents to sell, sell, sell, and that is where the other 10% comes in - to meet the unrealistic metrics of their repair center, some agents feel the pressure to add services to customer's accounts without their knowledge.  Comcast does nothing about this - just as long as you are selling.   You are given very little repair training in their 6-week training course, which is a joke.  During training, Comcast brings in Supervisors from the floor to talk about their great Comcast experiences.  They come in all smiles, helpful, friendly - but when you get on the floor - no more smiles or helpfulness. You are informed in training that if you EVER need to go to the bathroom go - but once on the floor - you get an IM from several Supervisors asking you to take your bathroom breaks on your own time.  Which if you start work at 1pm and your first break isn't until 3:45pm makes it a bit difficult to hold.  You get consistently scolded for going to the bathroom or helping out another agent because \"Aux\" time is way more important (FCC rules - so they say) than your well being or helping a co-worker. There is no consistency on the floor.  Some agents get by with sleeping at their desks and then others like me, just wanting to go to bathroom - gets a written warning.  Also, they give you 10 minutes to start your computer and all of the necessary programs to do your job. This takes a full 10 minutes. Then Comcast does not give you the opt. to review emails, service updates, trending logs, important information to do your job effectively.   Instead, they demand you do this on \"YOUR OWN TIME\", so basically you are working overtime, without the pay - the last I remember, this was \"illegal\".  I brought this to the attention of the director & vp of Comcast - was told to \"read quickly\".   Once I informed Comcast of this, is when I began receiving IMs from Supervisors about going to the bathroom. They pushed me out the door with their harassment.

All management knows how to do is micro-manage and change direction. Every new VP or upper management member that comes in drastically changes our direction and organization, just so they can look like they're trying to improve things. All this does is disrupt employees' lives by either a layoff or quintupling commutes! All for no real benefit. The micro-managing is done by middle and upper management trying to control things they have never done or have any idea about whatsoever. Different departments are at odds with each other.\r\nManagement will not even consider letting employees, whose whole jobs are on the PC, work from home. I believe this is more of their micro-management. Pay is different for employees doing the exact same job. Those of us who are motivated and work hard are given more work, while those who slack are left alone to slack off some more, even spending their day on IM with their love interest. . Upper management has enacted pay caps, basically eliminating employee motivation. I'm sure management hasn't capped their pay, have they? Great behavior for a multi-billion dollar company.\r\n\r\nSo much of customer service has been outsourced, both in and out of country, that the customer frustration factor has increased exponentially. Management needs to realize that you get what you pay for.\r\nSince removing motivation for long-term employees, it seems the drive is to try to get rid of those of us who have been here long-term in favor of new employees they can pay less.\r\nAlso, HR is completely useless; merely a mouthpiece for upper management. Their employee retention policy is to tell us \"be happy you have a job.\" WOW, there's a motivator.....to look elsewhere.\r\nUpper management is so disconnected from reality. They really have no idea what is going on beyond our stock price. You let the bean counters make WAY too many of the decisions.\r\nEmployee morale is is so low, as to be nonexistent. We all hate our jobs. The only thing keeping us coming in is our paycheck. This used to be a career for me, but since 2010, its just a paycheck. Employee morale is so low because we all know things will NEVER get better.

This is the only company I've ever worked for where a promotion came with a loss of about $300 per month in pay. They used a bait-and-switch tactic to fill seats in this department. The few technical support calls we do take we don't have the tools to support anyway because Comcast won't invest in its own company. The immediate supervisors are about as helpful as as a cup of ice in the arctic, and management is entirely too quick to come down on front line employees while leaving the supervisory staff is a state of anarchy.

The shift in management is still ongoing from my understanding.  \r\n\r\n-Always constant change with how the sales reps were able to make sales. One minute you might be paid for a sale, the next day, it might be taken away from the rep due to the area that it was sold in.  The next week, the rep may be able to sell in that same area again with no penalties.\r\n\r\n-Comcast is in competition with itself.  As a sales rep, I constantly had to not only sell against Direct TV, Dish Network, and AT&T U Verse, but also Comcast itself.  I had clients who consistently found better deals through Comcast.com, a local retailer, 3rd party retailers, etc than I was able to offer them.  The only way that I could insure a sale is by hoping to find the customer before they were able to find the lower sale price.\r\n\r\n-Your sales depend on many factors. \r\n 1. The call center has to key your sale in perfectly.\r\n 2. The technician who does the installation for the sale must show up for the job, do their installation up to standard and educate the customer on the products (to which sometimes a tech will blow off a job or work short cuts that will hinder the customer's experience).  \r\n3.  The customer must stay happy with your product or you will be charged back.  Most sales team managers will tell you that a customer must call 1-800-Comcast if he/she has a problem.  The problem is that if you present yourself as the direct liaison (to which you are encouraged by the team leaders  to do to get the sale) between the customer and Comcast, then the customer will be contacting you when there is a problem with their system.  The answer the team leaders tell you to give to the customer is \"Call 1-800-COMCAST\".\r\n\r\n-1-800-COMCAST has the worst customer service in the world.  You can be on hold for over 45 minutes and then your call is dropped.  Calling back within the very next second will cause the caller to have to wait possibly just as long again.  \r\n\r\n-Weekly meetings were always changed.  Sometimes the meetings were just a few phone call meetings and one meeting as a team at the local Comcast office.  My former team leader would have no regard for time and sometimes extend the meeting from late morning into the mid afternoon.  Then we were made to attend daily meetings at the office for as short as 30 minutes.  This would cause most sales reps to drive 30-60 mins to the office, just to turn around and drive 30-60 mins back to their designated turf areas.  Comcast would only reimburse the rep for $300 (before taxes) of gas monthly.  \r\n\r\n-When Comcast offered gift cards to close a sale between a sales rep and the customer, the company rarely ever delivered on giving the customer the gift card.  When I was a rep, we had a chance to lure a customer away from their current television/internet provider  by offering up to $400 in gift cards.  Many clients never received their gift cards which left stress between the client and the sales rep.\r\n\r\n-If the sales rep makes a mistake with a customer's order, and the order is completed or closed out, the stress is left between the customer and the sales rep.  The company will not try to repair the incident.\r\n\r\n-Team Leaders just want to keep their jobs.  Team Leaders would rather fight for their own jobs instead for their team member's even when they know the decisions of the company's sales management are ethically questionable.\r\n\r\n-Turf management (the sales reps respected sales area) for sales reps was directed by upper management based on clients and addresses who have not had Comcast before.  Most of those addresses designated by management were empty lots where there were unfinished subdivisions, or sometimes even Trailer parks that were no longer in existence. You cannot sell to a client or house that isn't there.\r\n\r\n-If you decide to leave the company, you will not be permitted to return.  Even if you were a top producing employee with no disciplinary record and have left a two week notice, you will not be permitted to go back to work for Comcast.  The inside word (from management) is that if an employee leaves the Comcast company then he/she will not be permitted to return due to the fact that since the former employee left Comcast in the first place, it shows a sign of non-commitment to Comcast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-Newer employees often felt disheartened toward coming into a job with shifting management", "Zero downtime, pay was much lower than that type of position should bring.

Too much focus on initiatives instead of understanding core business and the day to day (which is, admittedly, much more difficult).", "Comcast has created a method for which it can target employees, and eliminates them without the risk of being accused of wrongdoing. This method consists of pining its employees against each other, particularly the front-line employees against their own supervisors. Managers (the supervisors of supervisors) are tasked with holding meetings with front-line employees to solicit feedback on their supervisor's behavior. Of course, these meetings are sanctioned by HR and are held without the presence of supervisors. During the meetings, managers get the employees wound up to say anything, and will use this information to provide corrective action against the employees' supervisors. There is no need for the manager to have his own knowledge of the capacity of the supervisor. In fact, if the manager knows the supervisor well, he may be in a position to understand that the feedback provided by these meetings could be prejudiced, because of the \"gang up\" behavior produced when folks are free to talk without being held responsible for their words. If this personal knowledge were ever an issue (a liability in the process), they would rotate the managers to different work locations, eliminating any history between the manager and his supervisors. This way the managers will depend on the feedback provided by the front-line employees as the only source for corrective actions. This process is used against one supervisor at a time, and its main focus is to push unrealistic goals against all employees. The process is similar to what has been uncovered recently with the scandal related to Wells Fargo. Companies have to stay competitive, but some have found methods to boost their performance beyond the limits. What they do initially is create unrealistic goals for the employees. At first, the employees which are loyal to their own work ethics will be the first to go out the door. They will be dismissed for not meeting the goals. The ones that stay behind and survive realize that they can only do so by cheating. Although the company is squeezing the goals, it does not necessarily increase the level of ethics compliance. That is, it does not pursue ethics compliance as a hot potato, in the same way they pursue the goals watched by investors. The cheats then artificially increase the performance of the company, which is a win for the investors as well as the company, but not necessarily for the employees. Management understands that employees are cheating, although they act like managers are completely out of the picture, and they exhibit this extraordinary level of performance as a well planned, well executed, and natural occurrence. However, if they have a problem with an employee, all they have to do is expose the employee's ethics. I mean, at that level they could literally expose anyone and get rid of them. Unrealistic goals happen in many areas, but two of the critical ones are sales and quality. If the profits look unrealistic, it may very well be that the methods for obtaining these profits are also unrealistic, and primarily unethical. While I was working at the technical side of Comcast, the unrealistic goal was the repeat service call metrics (a quality measure that accounts for repeat service calls, within a 30 day period after a technician visits a customer's home). This metric was just below the 8%, and right now (a year after I left) it may be at 7% or less. Every year it was been dropped to a new and even more unrealistic level, with no sign of stopping, and every day you could increasingly hear the talk about how the cheaters made it happen. The team becomes divided between cheaters and non-cheaters. If a non-cheater tells a cheater; \"let's all be part of a team and tell us your methods, so we can improve our performance,\" the usual response is \"I'm not doing anything different than anyone else.\" It's essential for employees to learn and improve their performance through other folks' experiences (although this sharing of information is not really promoted within the company), but there is no real magic bullet that anyone is willing to share. These unrealistic goals create a level of stress that can't be properly managed by the employees, and a great part of it ends up as the wrath generated against supervisors during these feedback meetings. Since the managers depend solely on the feedback of these meetings to make critical decisions about the supervisors, the whole exercise provides a means to target supervisors at will, while at the same time continuing to stage unrealistic levels of performance for their employees. This happens without Comcast, or its upper management, ever becoming responsible for any prejudice done.  However, the prejudice is done with the targeted pinning of employees against themselves, as required by the needs of the business. It\u2019s a business driven with fear that produces a very toxic environment, with false readings and performance, and where employees are stripped of their humanity.", "After my hire they cut commission pay every 3 months until I had taken a 30% pay cut.

Not enough support on the floor, supervisors were never trained as reps, so they have no idea what is going on.

Be prepared to knock tons of empty houses and addresses that have duplicates in the billing system so you get to look stupid when they already have a triple play. Unfortunately, even if you know they are active, you still have to knock that door.\nIf you care about your reputation or about customer experience, do not get this job. It will only cause you stress. Trying to fix any problem will anger management, because you aren't getting more sales the more time you spend on an active customers account. If your supervisor loses your paperwork, you are expected to redo it. Management is never at fault for anything. The gas mileage allowance is taxed on your paycheck now, and won't cover half of your gas. If you ask question to find out how to do things correctly, you will only anger your boss. The training is a joke. Comcast will not teach you how to use any electronic system that you will have to use for work. They will constantly change rules without any internal communication. In March 2015, Comcast restructured the commissions and turf management. The majority of what reps were told were changed without letting any reps know. Expect quotas that are improbable to meet. Two home security sales every two weeks, yet the top ranking team had 1.5 home security per rep last fiscal month. Most reps will hardly ever sale a phone or a home security. Even if you do, charge backs will become the bane of your existence. Get 10 sales, maybe 5 get installed. Hopefully 2 won't charge back. Never sell to friends or family or neighbors. Either they will have problems or they will charge back on you. Be prepared to live on $27,000 a year, ruin a vehicle, be micromanaged, constant stress, and never have time with your family. This isn't a sales job. It is a constant dead end fight. Fight for your sales, your connects, your pay, and fight for the customer. Dead end at this job, because there isn't any career path. While fighting for the customer, you will learn that for a communication company, there isn't any communication between departments. Tech ops, direct sales, .com, etc are always at odds.

It lower the average commission by around 1000 or more a month. They also increased sales goals for most months during what they call the busiest months but most saw no increase in sales but rather a decrease and a clear drastic loss of income. Also, management use to give some leeway towards bad periods and take into account your overall sales performance but not anymore. If you fail to perform in just one two week interval you are written up and in that first write up you have to keep your sales on track for 6 periods aka 3 months or you go to stage 2 and if you don't perform in the next 6 periods you go to stage 3 then the next failed period and their showing you the door. They will badger you until you quit which is their MO by the way. They do this to avoid having to pay your unemployment. If you resign they will deny you unemployment.

When I say this I am saying they were dishonest ways of selling that effected my integrity. Comcast trains their employees to sell on lies and to not worry about the ones you have sold and don't distract yourself with their problems and sell, sell, sell. I wasn't for what I referred to as churn and burn sales. I cared about my customers so the reason I am not with Comcast anymore is obvious.

They have virtually impossible sales expectations but still want you to upsell products and services even when customers really don't need or want them.  It's no wonder they have been in the Customer Service Hall of Shame top 5 slots for the most part of the last decade.  It is completely pointless when filling out their internal surveys or participating in the focus groups (they claim to want to know your thoughts and opinions) because they never listen to their low level employees.  If you happen to be a member of management, you are never wrong even when it can be proven that you were wrong.  Non-management employees get blamed for everything and when you provide your evidence of their wrong doing or your innocence, you get labeled as some sort of a domestic terrorist.  Therefore, don't look for any type of praise but definitely expect to be reprimanded.  Also, don't look for any type of assistance from management.  Some of them could care less about helping you and the others can't help you because they don't know what they are doing.  There were very few supervisors/managers that actually knew the job and even fewer that cared.  Any type of upward or lateral mobility is a struggle even when you have the education, work ethic, and experience.  Plan on being stuck in that position of yours for a while.  Communication between departments is a joke.  The left hand never knows what the right hand is doing and vice versa.
