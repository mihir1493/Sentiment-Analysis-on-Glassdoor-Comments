1,5.0,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Tons of Opportunity, in your Hands","Working at Comcast has given me the opportunity to develop myself; take the time to grow and learn, and that was really important to me during the time in my life when I joined the company. If you have the drive and ambition, there are a ton of ways in which you can grow into a leader if that's what you want to be. I took advantage of the continued education benefit and am finishing my masters degree now... I also joined a couple of the employee resource groups which offer seminars and networking events that support your professional profile. Listen, I'm not a total nerd. The point of my post is that this isn't a company you join and just stay stale within. They encourage your growth, but it's up to you to make it happen. Not only this - it's pretty exciting. We're busy and we have big jobs to do. My salary is in the top percentile for my industry but not only this, I again get the continued education (which is ~$6K/year) plus free cable/internet, top health care benefits and a truly balanced lifestyle - which is rarely the case within the Tech industry.","Telling people you work at Comcast triggers 2 typical responses: 1) A big hatred rant on customer service 2) A how do I get my foot in the door? 

The reputation of the company is difficult, but the style of the company is to stay humble - I've never seen the company defend themselves against the harmful and discrediting news that exists. I personally think they should defend themselves a little more - they are between a rock and a hard place in many instances of service. I personally experienced visiting someone's home where the issues they were having with their connection was due to a tree root growing into the cable lines which had been their for over 20 years. Things like that cannot be diagnosed over a phone call. It's hard work in the field for sure. Being a part of the corporate side sometimes we're too disconnected from what's happening on the frontline.

The setup is truly terrible. And i have been a WFH employee at a previous jobs and this is truly the worse set up I have seen. The pay is very low for what is expected of you and being constantly monitors, its almost as if they treat you like its a high paying job. Everything you do is monitored so if you like that kind of job this is for you. The interview process is very extra. I did 3 interviews all of which i was asked the same questions by different people. On several occasions i had to track down the payroll supervisor because my check was short and missing hours. The job is very sales driven. My trainer was terrible he didnt answer people’s questions and none of us knew what they were doing when we started taking calls.

The company regularly covers up sexual harrassment in work place. they cover up retaliation from leadership and other coworkers depending on whom they favor more. leadership bullies reps to make impossible stats by threatening job loss all the time. customers are irate boligerant because company wants to build theme parks in tokyo instead of putting money into improving there system and tools to be more stable! they constantly change the stats to raise the bar so your best bet is to not let them promote you because you will quickly drown and get promoted to customer! trust me they don't want to do anything to support customers so why would they care about there employees lets be honest every employee is expandable and they are nothing more than a number.  Worst company i ever worked for to be honest. I would never recommend it to anyone! The amount of stress you get will slowly kill you.  Just to give an example of how bad it is... they give us broken useless tools... tell us to stick to scripted line of questioning that is useless and does not fix issue; only to come up with hey after you do that hit this button tell customer wait an hour to temporarily fix it! mean while they know they have had ongoing issue with new cable box platform for over a month where units religiously shut down and we temporarily fix then they hold us responsible for customer call backs and say if we had advised of self service options that don't fix the issue that it would've prevented the call back and we don't ask for 100%!

There is computer that listens to every call to make sure you are trying to sell every line of business Comcast has. It also listens to make sure you are using key words like love, like, favorite when it comes to the products. If you don't the computer drops your scores, which in turn drops your pay. If you lose a line of business or lower someones bill, your pay drops. There are daily meetings to ensure you will know how to sell more products, even to people who can't afford it. And you will have bi-weekly coaching to go over your numbers and advise you how to improve. And if you were wondering how you stack up to your fellow co-workers, no need to worry because the supervisors will post the whole teams personal score numbers in the chat. You are stuck at your position with no chance to move up for at least one year. After that time and if your sales numbers stay at a certain level for 3 months, then you can apply for a different position at the company. You are given X amount of vacation, flex, and float days, but don't use them on anything other emergencies. Once you run out no matter the situation, you will be fired for taking time off.

Great focus on Diversity and Inclusion, especially since 2020. The role itself is a lot of people management and performance reviewing. You don't have to manage schedules or anything like that because there's a different supervisor role specifically for those items.","Sometimes the workload is pretty heavy - especially if a peer promotes/transfers/goes on an LOA, etc. When team sizes start to get north of 14 it makes 1:1 coaching, call reviewing, meeting obligations, support chat hours, etc. much more difficult to do in a standard 40-50 hour work week - which then depreciates the salary. I've seen teams as high as 25 and that just seems impossible.

These changes often happen quickly and flexibility is expected by upper management when they do. On the other hand, if an agent needs IT support in order to do their job, or if a documented conversation needs approved by HR to be delivered, the same sense of urgency is not often displayed. 

Also when the region shifted to a division there's been a huge disparity in reporting tools and resources, which has caused myself and many peers a lot of frustration because of how that impacts the time it takes to do our job and the way in which we build our conversations with our direct reports.",2021-07-02, Customer Care Supervisor

There is free cable, internet, and free tickets once a year to the parks. The health benefits are good, and there is a stock plan. The devil is in the details. I would not come to work for Comcast in the Florida Indirect Channel.","DO NOT WORK FOR COMCAST IN THE FLORIDA INDIRECT CHANNEL.

I have been working with the company for several years, and have been a top sales producer (and have received high yearly reviews) in the division. I am saying this because this is not just another review from a ""disgruntled employee."" I like Comcast, and want them to get better. 

The onboarding commission was misleading. I thought I was going to be paid out at 100% for three months. Not only is this not enough time to build a book of business, but Comcast was misleading. 100% Month 1, 75% Month 2, and 50% month three is hardly enough to build a portfolio and a living in South Florida. This is one of the most expensive markets.

This is a review from a high-performing employee and I hope that the person who is reading this (and Comcast) takes this as honest constructive feedback. In hindsight I am ashamed of myself and why I have stayed with the company for so many years. I have unwittingly become part of the problem.

Comcast tells us to recruit small minority business partners (this is actually in our training- to target minority business owners) to enable them to sell residential services and then does not pay the Comcast Authorized Dealer (the business we signed up for). This has been an ongoing issue that the company is aware of for at least 6 years and has done nothing to fix it. The way Comcast gets around this is to hire a contractor (Actify or Leapfrog) and then pass the buck to them (it is their fault the partner is not getting paid). There have been literally times where dealers have come to me in tears due to the fact they have not received payment. In fact, during all my tenure at Comcast, I have never been able to reconcile a missed payment for a dealer. I am beginning to believe this is being done on purpose to exploit minority business partners because I have voiced my concerns to management over the past several years and nothing has been done about it. This is not a ""woke"" policy and needs to be closely looked at.

As an Indirect Account Executive if you do not ""recon"" a postpaid sale in a timely manner (before the sale is installed) the small business partner does not get paid. There is no system to pay the dealer. This makes you have to carry your company device at all hours of the day and night. This has caused significant mental health and physical health ailments because I have not been able to fully disconnect from my job in several years and caused me to be hospitalized on more than one occasion. I have not been able to go on a real vacation since I have been with the company. This has to do with dealer pay and account executive compensation. It is a major problem.

Comcast has missed employee commission paydays on more than two occasions causing myself and others to pay bills late and incur late charges. No explanation was given.

The overall comp for this position is below industry standards. I have exceeded large sales gains every year I have been with the company, and my pay gets lower and lower. There needs to be a better way to incentivize a salesperson. The way that goals have been calculated has never been properly explained in the Florida region. Your guess as to how I get paid is as good as mine. Many times goals have been loaded into Infoquest two and three weeks into the month making your ability to impact your commission check futile.

I have no idea still as to what it takes to get a promotion here. I have applied two times for advancement, and I am well qualified. Both times NO feedback was given to me. This I feel is not a good use of company resources as all of us want to get better at our craft. Clear feedback should be given to candidates after you spend all the time necessary to properly prepare for an interview. Due to this happening to me multiple times I stopped applying for roles within the company. Comcast engages in talent hoarding.

There have been several occasions where Comcast has not paid out commissions to the Indirect team causing my bills to not be paid on time. There was no reasonable explanation for this.

There was no budget for prospecting. Prospecting and attending community networking events cost money and is necessary for you to find prospects that will sell Comcast residential products. This came out of my own pocket.

The title of your job is Indirect Account Executive. Management expects you to sell the services yourself to customers if you are not meeting goals. I am all for that EXCEPT that if I am going to be directly selling, I expect to be compensated accordingly. Direct sales agents that are successful make a salary well above the six-figure range (Indirect Account Executives cannot make this amount due to the way goals are set in the Florida region). Recently, management has delivered ""door hangers"" and expects the indirect team to hang these on people's residential homes to drive business into retail and small business partners. This is not a good use of our time.

Comcast compensates small business partners 80-90% less for selling a residential double play than competitors like AT&T. Why has the compensation for dealers so disparagingly different? 

Interdepartmental communication when it comes to Prepaid Service is a major issue. There are many defective prepaid modems that are sold to customers from Boost Stores. The policy is that if the modem is defective the customer is supposed to call customer care, and they will send the customer another modem in the mail. But, due to a communication problem that has not been resolved for several years the customer comes back to the Boost Store, causes a scene (Boost is not equipped to handle returns), and then they have to exchange the modem at their expense.

I have sent several proposals to management about solutions to these issues and have never received a response. This is typical of the culture and lack of accountability at Comcast.

Salary is decent for the required work.","Your schedule for the year is determined in Q4 with metrics that are not released until at the start of Q4. So the only way to have a normal work-life balance is to be there long enough to gain a tenure team. Otherwise you are starting from ground zero with a fresh poorly performing team. Picture being told 3/4 of the year you are doing a great job, then the metrics that determine your future schedule, think 3-10 PM Tuesday-Wednesday off, comes up and your manager will tell you looks like you aren't doing a good job better make those numbers before your performance review. 

Managers will micro-manage every moment they can and confront you if you are not productive enough by 'their standards' not based on performance at all. It pays to do slow work and stretch out your 40+ hour work week. The longer it shows you working the better you are in their eyes.

Ageism at its best. Anyone can see that if you look at the managerial team. Education does not matter because every manager only has a high school diploma and it shows very quickly. I'm not being condescending I am simply stating the truth. Skills do not matter. Loyalty for 10+ years and kissing all your bosses a**es in the same position is the only way to get promoted.

Managers treat each supervisor different depending on their capabilities. Your co-worker could have a team 5 and you could have one of 15 and be paid the same but expected to do less because that is all 'they are capable of'. 

The best of all if you want to be a detective and get off on firing people that take medical time off and wait for them to slip up in their documentation or say the wrong thing. Then this is the job for you. 

Managers task supervisors to find who writes bad survey responses about them. On top of that supervisors are told up-front they have to put 10s only otherwise they have no 'backbone'. And if the over manager score goes too low we have a team 'talking to' about owning our issues.

For career development you can't go anywhere because the reputation of call center employees is so bad in the company (and for a good reason) that no one will even entertain you for a phone screen for another role.

Not all jobs here are bad. Just the sales roles.","Not sure where to begin. 

For commission, you get paid half when you get signature and half when it installs. 

There are major issues with getting things installed. When Comcast can't install, or when Comcast takes an insane amount of time and so the customer cancels the order; Comcast not only doesn't pay you the second half of your commission, but you have to pay them back the amount they already paid you. Doesn't matter if its because construction messed up, doesnt matter if its because the project manager lost track of it and didn't do anything with the order, you could do everything you are supposed to, you still ""OWE"" Comcast that money back. Thousands of dollars that comes out of future commission. 

Because of this, you spend a lot of time being a Project Manager yourself. Having to track down people and remind them to do their job. If you sell a site with multiple products, you will need to find teams of people who support all those products. Keep them on time, and manage that. It's an insane amount of work you MUST do, or problems happen, jobs get canceled, you now owe Comcast money. This takes time away from you doing your job, which causes you to not get as much sales, etc. 

Comcast doesn't pay nearly enough for us to not only do both of these jobs, but also to then take money away from you when the company messes up. 

It gets worse. When you get those cancelations, not only do you owe Comcast that money back, but it hits you negatively on your quota for the month. So you then have to sell that much more for you to ""hit quota"" and not get dinged for selling what you're supposed to. Because... if you don't hit quota.... you guessed it... Comcast takes money from your commissions. 

Its almost as if Comcast WANTs the sales people to fail. It's insane. 

The same role in many other companies pay so much more. Dont waste your time working in the sales organization at Comcast.",2021-09-02, Enterprise Account Executive

In each scenario for the BIPOC, the people helping them were cold, would ignore their concerns and then when they saw the notes on account that cited they talked to the spouse or other family member, laid blame on the caller. Within the scenerio with the caucasian lady, they coddled and shared personal stories and laughed with her. TOTALLY skewed. I was subjected to this exact training two times in the last year.

First starting off you’ll be limited on the size of business you can talk to and the products you can sell. So even if you drum up some business there is a good chance you’ll have to pass it off to someone else and only get paid a $150 lead bonus if it closes.",2020-07-26, Business Account Executive

They say it's easy to advance but once you're promoted once or twice its nearly impossible to get anywhere else like Tier 3, supervisor, analyst, IT, HR, admin supervisor jobs because they never open them up.

1462,2.0,"Former Employee, less than 1 year","""Rotating Cubicle Job"" with VERY small chance of career advancement in a fear driven Monopoly Company","- You can end up with a great group of people in your team (10-20 people group / cubicles), but then a month later be transferred to a different one. 
- Great health care, discounts from different companies (Ford, Jaguar some Cells phone providers and more)
- Some fun activities takes place like ""shooting hoops"" (in the cafeteria) for some prizes, these activities just a simple suggestion in HR books for releasing stress, and they don't care about it at all, plus they only allow it for you own your 30min lunch.
- If your weekly / monthly results a great & beats others, you get little gifts (cups, scarfs, t-shirts etc) closer parking spot for a week (the sad old big corp ""make you feel better"" tactics)","- Absolutely HORRIBLE Software / Tools to work and help customers. You have to start 5 different programs, 4-6 different tabs when you come in. Even the PC's struggle to run it all. It's so bad, we wrote BAT file our selves! This way you don't sit there for 10min before everything ready or like very often happens, you forget to open one of them & realize only when talking to a customers which takes another few minutes. I was blown away how such size ""monopoly"" company can have software older than some of its employees using it. Never seen anything like it, you would think they invest money to fix it, this way calls would shorten by 30%, fewer customers in Q or even better save $ since you would need fewer employees.
- You get 30min for lunch just like another 50 people. If you bring something that needs use of microwave forget about it, 3 microwaves for such head count will take 35min before you sit down with your meal. 1min late & system flags you. There is option to order food from outside food cook who runs little sandwich / cheesecake / salad business in the lunchroom with crazy prices. So get used to wending machine or will end up eating while at your desk like most.
- Some Tech Support team supervisors have ABSOLUTELY no IT experience, it was jaw dropping at first, but later you get used to stuffing like that.
- You are a number, NOTHING more. Which is very expect able from such company in size facility. It's like conveyor belt, one training class hits the floor next day you see new class forming and cycle repeats non-stop. It's due to very small % staying for longer then 6 months. Some people come with hopes without knowing how such companies operate. They don't care about you personally (which is perfectly normal) and after seeing how everything works you won't care about them, you are a number to them, and they are a paycheck to you. Most people get better offers while there and quit, others get let go due to low results. It's business.
- Management / Supervisors usually more scared then cubicle people. They know their success depends on their team (too bad team don't realize that) and due to lack of knowledge of the IT itself, the most they lack is leadership, people skills. So they end up sitting and praying for team to pass the metrics so the bigger guy won't come to have a conversation. 
- Apart just a gray cubicle desk job the whole feel of the surroundings is horrible, the tension so high, you can literally see the fear in peoples eyes which blown me away. The fake smiles (for 0.5 second) from upper management, the HR's question ""how are you"" which never follows with name since they have no idea is just a recipe 8 hours of horrible time for employees who already not making much in those gray cubicles...",2021-01-16, Tech Support Representative

This creates burnout and it’s hard to maintain after a while. 70% of the floor had FMLA for intermittent use and the other 30% were new and oblivious to the trick to meeting metrics. For example, the veterans work as many hours as possible and take as many calls as possible the first 2 to 3 weeks and then mysteriously become ill the last week by using their FMLA they don’t incur points because of attendance. In doing this it increases the numbers, thus inflated performance metrics. It’s a major issue so in my opinion the company forces turnover to weed out most of the veterans.

Felt like a bait and switch due to high performance of the team in the beginning of the program.
The team was awesome. Very friendly and helpful team full of potential leaders. They were the bright-side of my tenure with the company. 
Benefits package was excellent.
Severance package.
Autonomy","-They arbitrarily changed commission and salary pay without warning or notice. 
-They had no concrete game plan for the targeted market.
-They unilaterally changed sales targets without any actual data showing the increase in goals. To put it in perspective, I exceeded goal my first 5 months or so into the position, only to have it increased THREE FOLD. When questioned by the team, management responded with a Chinese arithmetic formula to explain why goals increased. Anyone that had previously questioned those goals and how the program was run (on my team) were excused after the company decided to ""restructure"" and have us interview....for our own jobs. 
-Company pride is one thing, but for the market we were tasked with selling to that pride looked like arrogance to the independent business owners we dealt with. Humility goes a long way within certain communities. 
-Mixed messages and inconsistent standards in the field. Expectations changed as the wind blows. After being a territory manager for the last 6 years I've never seen a company change their stance on expectations so sharply so frequently. The real issue is that none of those changes were reflective of the actual field team reports. They were decided by management that never set foot in the actual territories to see the similarities and differences within each market. My direct manager was awesome. He went to my glorious territory and saw the challenges and opportunities. That's not the issue. His direct management, the decision makers, didn't seem to value that feedback at all. It showed in the overall cohesion of the to teams, who scrambled and did their best with what they were handed on a day to day, and week to week basis. 

In closing, the initiative was hastily put together, with little consistency or clear vision, and as the old saying goes, it rolls downhill. I watched tenured members of the team lose their livelihood with no explanation whatsoever. The ""why"". Covid seems to be an excuse for these unregulated, monolithic companies to take full advantage of hard working, honest, caring American workers, and if nothing else shows you to become your own business in some regard. The lesson? Any company that goes out of their way to show ""they care"" is masking something more insidious underneath. Be humble. Work hard. Do not voice any critique or even suggest changes. The crony system is in full effect in corporate America. Hope this helps someone. Peace and blessings to you all.",2020-12-14, Indirect Account Executive

I can back from LOA, the manager request the pot to be sent again they took forever and i put my 2 weeks notice and i left on good terms and when they finally decide to send it out since i quit they claim they don’t give incentives to former employee.

2210,3.0,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",Good transitional job. Don’t stay here too long though,Comcast’s benefits are amazing. Free universal tickets and great insurance. They also do what they can to keep employees engaged with parties and incentives.,"Management is very aggressive when it comes to meeting quotas. They use fear tactics and threaten your job security constantly if you aren’t meeting your metrics. The metrics that they have in place can be difficult to achieve. Especially during Covid-19.

The work / home life flexibility is pretty rough too. They give you an adequate amount of time off but micromanage how and when you can use it. You must adhere to a strict schedule that literally plans out every minute of your day.  Also, they only do schedule changes once per year. So if you get stuck with something you don’t like, there is no way out of it.

The pay structure is a joke too. They basically give you a fixed payout regardless on what you sell. They call it a “guarantee”. It used to be whatever you sold was what you earned. Now they give the guarantee so that they don’t have to pay out too much. Even if you perform it’s very difficult to surpass the guarantee. Feels like they are forcing you to leave money on the table. 

The biggest negative I got from the company was how poorly they treat their top performers. Instead of giving them a pat on the back and a thank you, they start investigating you and look for any flaw or inconsistencies in your sales method to get you fired. Simply because they don’t wanna pay high salaries to top earners.
I have seen many great sales reps leave the company because of how poorly they were treated.",2020-08-19, Inbound Sales Representative

So they lack the insight, prospective and knowledge of what it take to be successful. You have to compete with your own company via call center, online and local store. Because you are completely cold calling you get know advantage over the other channels that don't cold call. Which the company would prefer that customers use rather than the residential outside sales rep whom are not order takers. In your specific territories that you are assigned to cold call knock each house is color codes. They only want you to target what they have determine to be high value customers. These HVC are coded green that can change at any time. The houses targeted will be coded green, but can literally change at any given time based on internal metrics that cause it to no longer be a qualified green targeted home. Things like home may be occupied by an older person or a single younger millennial. Individuals that they perceive to be customers they won't get most or all the Xfinity services. Folks that they perceive won't spend money on higher packages won't be targeted in your territories. You will be on a street with 50 homes and only 4 or 3 will be targeted. Also, the home history will effect whether its a targeted green or not. If the home had late payments, and old unpaid balance, or not a multi family home even though it not even the same individual who was there before, the house won't be targed. So a new person totally unrelated to the prior owner or renter will be effected color code wise. The house is rated base on all these things and more. If the individual house was green and that person inquired about service, but didn't get it. They and other factors with change the color on the home green to red. You can literally talking to someone at the time that it's green and targeted and when they decide to finally sign up under you, the home can literally no longer green and targeted and won't be a in turf fully paid sale. Any sales made outside of your assigned green territory will not count towards your monthly quota and you will only get paid 25%. Any homes in your territory that's not green will not count towards your quota and you will be paid 25% referrals are penalied .The same homes that are green and targeted for you to cold call are also being mailed special offers with gift cards and free installs that you can't offer. Which is done to take the sale from you even if you made prior contact. You get nothing, management is poor, lazy and protect their favorites and show a blind eye to those they like . Upper management doesn't care about fairness, and you will be retaliated against for point this out not matter how much they tell tell you other wise. Latinos and whites are favor more and opportunity to move to other sales channels aren't allowed much and are flat out blocked. Business sales channel would rather bring in someone new off the street then promote a residential sale rep to businesses. HR is bias and cover for whom they want.

Which is fine I suppose, except opportunities to advance are based off of SIX calls per month. Let me explain- we take between 250-300 calls per month on average. So you’re being judged on less than 5% of your calls. Providing feedback to the company during their “surveys” is pointless- after the end of it they only highlight the positive reviews (which are few and far between) and our concerns are swept under the rug. You are truly just a number at this company. They’ll trick you into thinking this is a job where you can build a career but it’s a complete lie. The customers are impossible to deal with.

I was the guy that the junior level designers came to for tips and tricks. The bully was the designer who had been there the longest and had the most to lose from my rapid growth in hindsight. When it came time to promote said bully I was supportive because I had always been impressed by his competencies. Once he was promoted he began to treat myself and another team member like rivals. The time came for me to lead another high stakes project and this time with a few other team members made up of an junior level designer, the bully and the bully’s intern. Yes, the bully had an intern that he not only hired but enlisted to bully me too. I was very excited for this opportunity to lead a team of designers at Comcast as it was a great growth opportunity. The bully undermined me almost everyday, even going as far as taking my team to another room in the building to generate concepts for my project without inviting me. My boss and the bully were buddies. So when I brought up my concerns my boss didn’t give any importance to my claims. I confronted the bully and tried to clear the air in hopes that we could work better together. I was very diplomatic and felt upon leaving that discussion that progress was made. But the bully later sent me an email on a Sunday without CC’ing my boss saying he was going to remove me from presenting a project and would do the presentation to the executive himself and that I would not be speaking, without any grounds to do so. I immediately forwarded the email to my boss asking for guidance. I really didn’t know what to do, I just wanted this to stop, because I enjoyed my job and wanted to get back to that. There was a study from 2012 that concluded that once you are a target of a workplace bully, you are 77.7% likely to be terminated or quit. Well I was terminated and one of my team members that was bullied too quit shortly after citing the bully as the reason. I was a Senior level Designer and my team member that quit was a Lead level designer. I carried about 40-45% of the teams total work load and the Lead Designer carried about 10-15%. Losing us decreased the capacity of that team to deliver that amount of productivity because of this bully. Before I started there we two other similar level designers on this team and I can only imagine that they may have really left for similar reasons. Comcast you have a problem on that team and it affected two designers, maybe four and potentially will affect future hires.",2019-09-19,

3082,1.0,"Current Employee, less than 1 year",Temporary Employment Until You Land Your Real Job,"Good Benefits, Good Friends, Free Food","The OBSR Job itself.  Spend 8 hours a day in an auto-dialer working tired, worn-out, unrefined leads...and sounding like a complete idiot on the majority of these calls while you're waiting for the computer screen to catch up to who you have on the phone.  You will call about 100 businesses each day (or more) and most of them hang up on you the instant they hear the word ""Comcast"".  Those that don't are likely already Comcast Business customers which shouldn't be in your list in the first place since the OBSR position's focus is NEW ACQUISITION.  But...in spite of the company being keenly aware of this problem, they do NOTHING about it other than encourage you to sell whatever lines of business the customer doesn't already have, regardless of whether it's a service that will benefit the business or not.  When I say worn out and tired leads, I'm also talking about the fact that the company recycles leads like crazy and changes the name of the list but not the leads in the list.  Here's the basic formula for the OBSR department: spend as little on leads as humanly possible and keep constantly hiring more poor suckers to call through them over and over again...then, after the Marketing OBSRs are done with a list, send it over to the Qualified OBSRs and call all those poor souls that didn't get weeded out of the list a few more times.

Also, you will call a TON of Home-Based Businesses that are already using Xfinity Residential Service and you're expected to flat out LIE to the customer about how much better Comcast Business service is to justify the much higher price point.  The truth is that there are only a few differences between Xfinity and Comcast Business and those are rather minor differences at best.  

Additionally, Comcast has a TERRIBLE reputation in the industry and in spite of claiming that ""customer service should be our best product"" they are doing very little to back those words up with any sort of action.  At least once every couple days you'll call someone the company has burned in the past and that person is going to let you have it.  

One other thing to be aware of is that the company does not work together.  As a telemarketer, you'll fight to keep sales that the door-to-door guys will steal.  Other phone jockeys even in your same call center will also try to poach your deals.  Many of the technicians will tell your customers all kinds of crazy things to get out of doing their job.  Other departments are set up as checks and balances and will reject deals you submit for all kinds of silly bureaucratic reasons...which means your customer has to wait while the company foolishly fights amongst itself.  

I could go on here all day listing cons...but these things above are the major issues.  The bottom line is, if you don't mind making a total fool of yourself through no fault of your own, telling people outright lies in order to get deals, and working for a company that people truly hate...it's not a bad place to work, at least while you keep interviewing at other places where one can take pride in being an employee there.  However, if you're any sort of decent salesperson who has ethics, integrity, and any sort of moral compass, you're not going to want to stay there long.  Like me, you'll be looking for another job elsewhere where you won't be ashamed to tell people where you work.",2019-10-22, Outbound Sales Business Representative

Depending on the team you're on, you can get quite a different job experience. Comcast is still run as a mainly financials driven company despite their outward appearance as a new-age tech company. As such, some newer types of management styles and work culture norms (think Silicon Valley) may be frowned upon. This is hugely dependant on the team you're on. If you're more business facing, expect to get an old school approach on culture and management. If you're more IT, expect a more laid-back approach. At the department that I work at, certain higher up leadership monitor what time people come into work and leave the office. I think that is a huge mistake. Besides this, helicopter management or micromanaging is rampant in EBI. Good work gets done in EBI but it is lost in the political catfighting and power grabbing that's occurring.

The company spends capital to grow the network and serve new customers to a higher degree than competitors.  It is fairly easy to position Comcast Enterprise services.  Good health and employee benefits including low cost cable TV and Internet for your home.  Sales training is decent.","There are many complicated pre and post sales processes that interfere with one's ability to prospect and make sales.  A high quota and ever decreasing average deal size adds challenge and stress to meeting goals.  Selling involves a high amount of documentation and tedious steps to process a sale and therefore may not be a fit for candidates who dislike spreadsheets and micro management.  The company develops agent /indirect partners and hires inside sales reps that directly compete with the EAE for the same customers / sales.  Your territory is not really your territory.  They move your customers away from you to an account manager after 12 months.  So, you often only get a small piece of the customer's potential sales before it becomes someone else's benefit to reap what you sewed.   It is not true Enterprise, nor even mid market very often.  70% of sales are single location Internet and voice service.  They claw back commissions if a customer does not get installed and it happens semi-frequently due to construction delays and less ideal performance by a constructiin or project management partner.  The sales rep incurs 100% of the risk but has little control over outcome.  The company routinely makes changes to processes designed to help a different department, like operations, but adds new burdens on sales people and negatively impacts customer experience.  Comcast Business does not sell globally, therefore it is not addressing a large potential customer segment which limits your potential sales.   Incentives and salary compensation are about 40% lower than current market price for a similar role in other technology companies.

3158,2.0,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Great for stability, terrible for ambition.","Great benefits and salary is reasonable for the area. Flexibility is nice especially if that's what you need in your life at the moment. Your job is generally very secure and safe and you have a lot of of wiggle room when it comes to performance and keeping your job. 

If you are looking for a long, stable career in one place with a lot of flexibility then Comcast might be a very good fit.

Very much one of the few companies that I feel truly understands and does ""diversity"" right. Its not just a token effort but is very much ingrained in the culture.","Its a very large company so your personal experience can vary widely depending on your specific team and manager.

If you are ambitious and looking to accomplish great things you will find a lot of cultural resistance. There is a tendency to do work for the sake of staying busy, and not to actually accomplish anything. A lot of groups are protective of their own processes/work and resistant to potentially positive changes. 

Management tends to treat every single project as the most critical which ultimately leads to a lack of trust - especially when internal products or project results are dropped within weeks of completion. Personally I have just completed my third project in a row where the finished product has gone ignored by the same stakeholders who were stating how vital the project was for the company's success. 

There is an overall lack of accountability when it comes to project success.  Projects can slip in terms of budget and timeline by several months and hundreds of thousands of dollars and sponsors or project managers will simply move the goal posts. Very rare to have any revisiting of projects a year+ later to see if the business case has panned out or if returns have been met. No sense of lessons learned and mistakes are very often repeated. 

Be careful about promises of internal movement/promotion, especially across functions. Its possible to be able to advance through job openings on other teams, but it will be entirely on you to find these and pursue them. There is no sense in the broader company of an internal talent marketplace and often managers will look outside first - in my opinion this is due to lack of support from the talent acquisition teams. The Career Profile was advertised as a solution to this, but I have yet to hear about a success story where an individual was contacted by other groups within the company for opportunities or to work on new projects, or of any manager who used this tool when making a hiring decision. Your own resume, LinkedIn profile, and networking will do a lot more for your internal career growth than the Career Profile will.",2019-07-11, Senior Analyst

There hasn't been one issue that has gone unresolved. There are many benefits to working here...outside of near-free employee accounts there is the job security.  I like working in an environment where we are not only constantly busy, but it is an ever growing, exciting, educational and challenging job. I've been here several years and wouldn't leave if you paid me. Comcast gives every employee no less than two weeks of vacation time every year as well as over a week of flex time (sick days, etc.). The amount of vacation time increases over time. You will lose the time if not taken during the year because of the work-life balance. There is also 401k, stocks, discounts, etc. The pay, even starting out, is generous. Benefits are available quickly after hired.","Quotas, which are sometimes a challenge, are very obtainable. There are stats each employee must maintain. The most difficult part of the job has nothing to do with anything related to comcast...and that is dealing with customers. I work in a fast paced call center where some calls pertain to outages or to the customers own equipment or devices, and people are passionate about service. Some people are friendly, some are merely having a terrible day. My challenge is to turn the call around and make their days a little better...leave them with the feeling that we do truly care about our customers. There are many supervisors divided into teams.

There is clear favoritism - if you side-eye any of the shenanigans encouraged by leadership you are branded as ""negative.""

3366,1.0,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",Sounds good but doesn't fulfill promise - disrespectful,"Co-workers - you meet a lot of very nice people, all in the same horrible situation. Free services.","Management and Corporate do not care abut Techs or similar level employees. Company has a conduct policy that only applies to non management workers. management is allowed to treat workers any way they please, up to lying about them to get them fired. Corporate cares less, and the company is always hiring because its always firing people because the Supervisors get rid of people according to crony-ism. When people move up, its because someone likes them - for any reason - rather than whether they qualified for the job or not. I was terminated, but if someone from Corporate decided they liked me today, I would be back working tomorrow. That's how they work on that end. So imagine if they DON'T like you...

Their performance evaluation system is flawed, does not take in account sickness, time off, and punishes Techs for things out of their control, such as jobs they were not on or responsible for. The system is designed to just trust whatever a Supervisor says, so whether something is your fault or not, the Supervisor can just leave it on you and nobody will listen to your protest, valid or not.

They have a system of appeal, called Comcast Listens. Its also corrupt because they snitch to your direct Supervisors when you report anything. After that, they do not look for the Management's errors or transgressions, the investigator who is supposed to be helping YOU will look for something to attack YOU with, because you are not part of management - you can be fired for reporting to Comcast Listens. They Listen - and then they fire you. knowing that Corporate is lazy and uncaring, Supervisors will just keep writing you up, keep lying on you, until they can just fire you.

The training is a joke - but on top of that if you ask them they will warn you about trying to learn more on your own as if it's a violation. Techs are given no time to learn anything anyway, as they are worked to death, in a rush and no care about safety. They do the old ""You have to do all this, we know you have no time to do it... but that's on you to figure out"" game. or example, we were told we are not to do wall wishes anymore, but in an unclear manner. When you try to clarify it with a definitive yes or no, they won't give you that - instead they keep putting in a way that basically says ""The real answer is no - but we want you to just do it anyway AND DONT GET CAUGHT..."".

All they care about is numbers. If the Supervisor is incompetent, he starts firing all the new or under performing people on his team. The refuse to change the companies expectations to be more realistic. Most other companies in this industry expect up to 5 jobs per day. (At&T for example - who pays double the salary for half the work). Comcast wants you to do 11 - 15 jobs per day. They trivialize some of the jobs as ""only trouble calls"", but for one, they give you a shortage of ten minutes  (20 minutes in an hour) of time to do them, and second, if the trouble call requires more work - which 80% fall in this category - they do not give you more time without punishment. They under time you and then punish you because of their mistake. Then they brow beat you, telling you it's your fault that your team-mates have more work to do, when in fact it is because they are slamming you with too much work and not making adjustments when the work becomes more than they thought it would be. 

The  discipline system is designed to cycle through workers. HR , Management, Corporate - they have nice secure jobs, support and a quality appeal in times of unfairness. But the workers beneath them are fired for TWO UNRELATED OCCURRENCES! TWO??? And as I explained earlier - they don't care how they came about, or who wrote them. I had lies placed in my files, I protested them, they acknowledged them - and then LEFT THEM. Over a half a year later HR calls me in (they don't tell you why until you get there) and terminates me. The issues they wrote me up about were untrue - but despite going all the way up the ladder to Corporate about it, all they did was ask the same people who lied about me for more incidents, and then told me I did these ""other things"" so they are going to let the defamation stand and allow me to stay un-vindicated and unemployed. This is how they work! They rather keep corrupt Supervisors there, wasting money continuously training new hires than get rid of the rats sinking the ship.

Oh and one more thing about training. Its barely enough. They rush you through training, and then they throw you out in the field. The Supervisor can pull you out of training and have you do jobs if he feels like it - even if you really don't know anything. They dont care if you get it or not - even the teachers complain how ridiculous the training is. If you speak out about the horrible experiment - which is what their training sessions are - they treat you like you have a learning disability and start working on firing you. They have little meetings about you behind your back so you cannot defend yourself and then come at you with a decision, often misrepresenting you.

The real irony here is when they have meetings they ask workers and evry meeting - for YEARS, the workers bring up the ridiculous expectations. Management acknowledges it, offers some BS solutions, says they are working on it - but yet Techs are still getting fired behind it. They will not suspend the broken evaluation system even though they know it is antiquated and does not match up to the changes in the Tech's job. Furthermore, other supporting departments, like Dispatch, are given Carte Blanche to shift issue responsibility on to the Techs - when they mess up the scheduling, which they do every day - the Tech gets punished because they can't perform on time. Management once again lies, saying Dispatch is held responsible - but they never take the blame off of the Tech - no, you SHARE that punishment, even if it's totally not your fault. Comcast is a complete mess, and it's a shame because it doesn't have to be. You want to see why your shares are not performing well? Look at the way they handle the Tech responsibilities - it is bleeding money and it isn't the fault of the Tech - it's the management who could care less about Comcast or the workers. They know it is broken and have given up, so they just let the bad stuff just keep rolling.",2019-07-05, Comm Tech III

Your experience is heavily dependent on the type of person your supervisor is. It’s supposed to be a job where you aren’t micromanaged and expected to know how to do your job correctly but you will absolutely be micromanaged if you get a supervisor who operates like that.

Your (usually tiny) territory isn't safe, and neither are the accounts you work--other local account reps and the inside sales team can waltz in and snatch whatever they want up. You'll likely run into at least 5-6 customers a day that are frustrated, because they've already been called on by other Comcast Business reps that week. 
-Micro management is ingrained in the culture. You'll be expected to report every metric you can think of, every day. When I left, they had reps writing up a bare minimum 3-sentence report for every single contact they made that day. Also be prepared for your manager to text you as late as 11pm and early as 5:45am.
-If you have suggestions on ways to adapt certain procedures/scripts to your market, you'll be reprimanded. Corporate's word is law, and how dare you know what'd work best for the local culture that you're working in every day?! Every person, situation and territory functions exactly like sales role plays and trainings done in Philly, period. You better not dare question that or your job will be threatened.
-Most managers will hoard the hot leads across their region for their drinking buddies. If you try to contest it, or get to that account first through door knocking, they'll chew you out for ""stealing business"" and ""breaking the rules of engagement"".
-Think this is a M-F job? Ha! You'll be pressured to work AT LEAST one Saturday a month. If not more, depending on your manager. If you decline because you have other obligations, be prepared to be put on blast for it at your next team meeting.
-There's no care for employee safety, despite this being an outside sales role. Severe thunderstorm? Better be knocking! Tornado watch? Why isn't your number of doors higher?! Live in a Southern state that can't handle snow, and you've already gotten record breaking amounts of it that's shut down your entire territory? Ha! Just a little snow!

I've seen some reviews for thePlatform here that are just blatantly untrue. I've worked with the company for a substantial amount of time now and feel that I have a pretty good idea about the competencies and culture.  I started working at thePlatform at a low-level position and was able to ""raise the ranks"" as it were.  Granted, it took some self-motivation and work to be able to do so, but I would never be one to expect that a position be handed to me.

It is true that there has been some movement with administration in the past couple of years.  Largely this was due to individuals finding greater opportunities be it personal or professional.  Which, may I add, was always met with support from the company in whole.  Our company does it's best to handle any kind of departures such that it doesn't affect the business/department/individuals and I think it has done an exemplary job.

Also do not sign up for their security, you will pay for cameras that you cannot use after leaving comcast, you will waste 300 dollars on that wasteful system, beware the cameras arent transferrable.

Only pro i can think of is some guys u work with are cool, some are also stupid for making this job a career and are getting ripped off with crappy pay.","Micromanagement to the bone!!! Repeats have gotten worse! Every job whether its a small job where all u gotta do is work on the outside of the home still hurts your peformance if customer calls about something wrong in the inside.

Time frames are the dumbest thing!

(The customer agents from syria)-act like they are in a special needs group. Cant talk correctly, and they will put anything as the problem in the home, like telling customers you will come there and change all the equiptment for free.

(Internet x the customers)- customers will complain because they pay for 400 mbps and they computer is only allowed to pull 200, so now u are there tryna convince a customer that they computer is the problem, it will clearly result in a Repeat, and its nothing you can do about it.

(Raise)-You will never get a raise now with these new metrics they rolled out, they made its twice as hard now to move up, and its still just as long. Moving up takes 6 months to do, no matter how good you are or how much experience or awards you get. You will be in one title for years here, so if u com tech 2, get prepared to be that way for 2 years i guarantee it.

(Vans)- you will drive the oldest vans ever, some of these vans were created when i was 8 years old and im 22 now so you do the math, it will be roaches in the vans. And you will break down a couple times as well. 

(Everybody is off at 6:30)-no matter what, jobs stop rolling normally around 5:50 but comcast wont let you sit and wait til 6:30, they will give you some crappy job to do at 6:10 or 6:15 right before its time to go home, and it will probably be a job where u gotta pull your ladder out and climb a pole.

(Pedestals)-, they put the pedestal in the worst areas i notice like you will have to jump a fence to get to somebody yard because they locked their gate and u cant go over and work on what you need too. We used to be able to no access a job if you cannot get into a yard to work on it, now they took that away and you have to just take a repeat if you cannot get back there.

(Pht)- you cant even close your job because of this feature called pht, its a home check and it looks at everything, i mean everything, even things you cant even work on, so if you try to close your job and it has a red x on it, be prepared to spend another hour trying to fix a problem thats not even customer related. Most of the time it fails because of the network team yet you still gotta find a way to fix everything, aka your taking the blame!

(Network team)- god forbid you have to call them to verify its an issue on there side, they will grill you, talk to you with no respect tell you that its your fault and make you do extra things just to prove to them that its not something you can fix.

(Bonuses)-after like 4 months you get this taxed bonus check that is given to you based on how you peformed in a quarter, its also based on the whole office peformance, so if the office did bad, guess what! Your bonus will be bad, highest you will get being new to the company is 450 dollars extra on 1 check. They tax it heavy.",2019-04-24, Comm Tech II

-Good managers are easy enough to find in the HQ environment","-You will hear MANY people share the anecdote, ""you have to leave the company and come back to get ahead."" Very true. Only small incremental gains as long as you are advancing internally. Company policy does not really allow for significant career gains at any given time. Keeps everyone more or less on the same pace regardless of motivation, competence, etc. Very frustrating as a ""go getter"" type actively managing their career.
-Must stay in a role 1 year before you can move between roles even if it is not a good fit 
-Pay increases are capped at 10% regardless of what role you are moving from/to 
-Could not get assistance from recruiters when searching for a new job internally. Tried to contact recruiters to put my resume on file, let them know I was interested in advancing, talk about roles, etc., but they just kept saying they ""didn't have anything.""
-Cannot skip professional levels when transferring (within or between departments) even if you are qualified, and there is no interdepartmental calibration of professional levels
-You can appeal some of these rules via HR exemptions and with the help of your direct manager if you have a good relationship, but it feels like their way of saying ""we don't REALLY want people to advance here""",2017-12-07, Anonymous Employee

They no longer hold a competitive advantage with VOD offerings and other companies' technology offerings are on par with, if not superior, to what is offered by Comcast.  Using rights fees and similar explanations doesn't hold much water with customers if other companies have to pay those same fees and have lower TV prices.

3620,4.0,Former Employee,Hoping they get it right soon,Free cable and Internet. Opportunity to learn. Great new building.,"Comcast is a company in need of transformation. From its routes as a family owned monopoly cable company, Comcast has grown to become a multi-product communication and entertainment company with strong competition in every facet of its business. Unfortunately, the company leadership failed to recognize the need to become customer focused or customer friendly. 

And in some ways, Comcast remains a family company - albeit a dysfunctional one.  There is a core group of ""in"" people ""the family"" and if you are not part of that group  it can be difficult to advance. And once somebody acheives ""in status"" they become barriers to change working very hard to make sure they and their friends do not get tarnished with bad news. The few who do tell the truth - competition is growing or customer satisfaction is non existent -  run the risk of being alienated.  Unfortunately, this has lead to a culture of ""no bad news"" or ""figure out how to blame someone else"".  We sometimes wondered if Brian Roberts was getting the whole truth.",2008-06-21, 
3621,2.0,Current Employee,If I only knew...,"Probably the best reason to work for Comcast is the free services that they give to new hires. You will meet some good people along the way, and make connections that may help you as you work your way up the ranks to middle management. I really can't think of too many reasons that Comcast is a great place to work for. The benefits package is at least somewhat respectable, but with a company that makes billlions in revenue, it's sorely lacking. The support given from management is passable. Yet, I would expect better training from a industry leader such as this.","The downsides are numerous. I'll start with the basic job function of answering calls from the customers. The customers are demanding pretentious folks who think they deserve the red carpet treatment because they have service from us. On most calls you are cursed at, demeaned, and insulted in any and all number of ways. The support tools that Comcast supplies its employees are buggy and filled with glitches. When attempting to get a supervisor to help out a customer in need, first of all, good luck in finding one actually on the floor. Second of all, when you tell the supervisor the issue, they respond with apathy and act like you are disturbing them. On top of this there are unrealistic expectations, no real support from the supervisor level up, and a general lack of training and development.",2009-03-13, CAE

Growing company that is very strong and great for investment.,"The Peter Principle in all its glory. 

Comcast encourages hiring form within, but you have to apply to open jobs. They very rarely promote. They will give preference to internal versus external hires. They have a maximum 10-12% ceiling for pay increase when you move up, and a maximum 3.5% annual raise (but don't expect that much unless you get ""highly effective"" for every criteria of your annual review). If you start out underpaid because you got your foot in the door after college, you will forever be underpaid. Unless... you jump around positions taking advantage of the 10%. 

What you get is people shifting around constantly, nobody actually staying in their role long enough to learn it, managers that have reached their incompetency levels, and  their managers are so incompetent that they don't notice their subordinates incompetence. Nobody likes efficiency because that means less busy work. As long as they look busy, the managers are so buried in their own troubles they don't know who is under performing.

Systems used by employees are outdated and poorly designed.  The company is outsourcing much of their jobs as long as they are not customer facing.  The only thing keeping this company afloat is their non-competition footprint where other cable providers agree not to offer competing services.  If a fiber provider moves into their internet service area, they will lose their internet service customers because they cannot compete with a fiber offering.  If a company develops an internet video package with comparable channel offerings, I believe that Comcast will fold.  The company's internal communications are very disorganized.  It is nearly impossible for customer support staff to contact dispatch to get any information on the status of field technicians, or contact the NOC to escalate network issues.  Annual wage increases are so low that any significant increase in income requires promotion.  Management makes little to no effort to promote their employees.  The company gave no notice prior to laying off my team and my position was posted on their job board under a different management region (to avoid being sued) the same day.  This company has no qualms about laying off large teams and hiring others to do the same jobs at lower wages in different regions to increase profit.",2017-06-29, Senior Analyst

They ordered food for the entire company weekly/biweekly from Davanni's, Leeann Chin, plus other local food delivery places.

Great coworkers and tons of people willing to help with any issues that would arise. Most supervisors and managers were easy to talk to and willing to listen (Of course, like with any company, there were a couple 'bad apples').

Benefits including health insurance and dental were top of the line - We had Health Partners for health and Aetna for dental.

There are TV's literally everywhere and when it's slow or on your break you can relax and watch a movie or show. We would order pay per view and watch big boxing matches on the weekends.

The chairs, desks, and computers are all top of the line. If you needed anything ergonomic, you could ask for it.

A good amount of PTO and unexcused absences available (in case of sickness, kids, or late night partying)

Overall, they did what they could to keep people within the company. Everything is top notch, from the pay structure to the 'amenities' - Great company to work for if you can put up with the actual job :)","A lot people hate Comcast, some with valid reasons, some not. There are a lot of customers that love Comcast, but those people don't call in to tell you that. You only hear from 15% of their customers, and those 15% call A LOT. Even in this day in age, most people don't realize that their awesome promotional rates expires after 6-12 months. The majority of your calls are ""why did my bill go up""; and, 95% of the time in billing, there was nothing you could do to lower their package pricing down. Package pricing and why the billing increased are the majority of your calls.

Those calls mixed with, ""why am I charged $50 for you to fix my outlet (obviously not free, call a local repair man next time and see what they charge"", ""I didn't order this movie, remove the charge"", ""no one told me there would be an install charge"", ""why did I lose channels"", and ""no one told me a DVR would cost more monthly"". I could do on and on but you get the gist and what I'm trying to get at is, you get yelled at a lot. Since most reps get yelled at all day, they in turn don't bring a lot of enthusiasm to work and then pass those feelings onto the next person they talk to.

One of biggest issues as a billing representative is Comcast sales reps have a lot of pressure to make sales. It seemed to me and others that sales reps would neglect to mention details about how the pricing works, lie about install charges, when items increase etc and then we would have to try and fix the mess.

Most new reps start with the late shift, when I was there it was 12:30 - 9PM, and you got split days off. Most people have to work Saturday. I got Thursdays and Sundays off (company is closed on Sundays) - There were trying to fix scheduling so I'm not sure where it's at now.

Since Comcast has 30+ Million customers, there were a lot of out sourced reps from India taking calls as well and that can lead to communication issues internally and complaints from Comcast's customers.

Comtechs never know when they will get home.  Scheduling of jobs is unrealistic.  Often times, big installs that will take hours are scheduled for late in the day.  If I got off my shift within an hour and a half of the scheduled end time I felt lucky.   Almost never got out on time.  They simply schedule too many jobs each day.  Then they say they want every step followed in the field, but there is no way to do it.   The math does not add up.  So, techs end up skipping steps like going to tap on every job.  If you want to be home at a reasonable time each night, this is not the place for you.  If you have little ones at home that go to bed early, forget seeing them because you will be at work if you are doing it all by the numbers.

They offer over 5500$ per year in tuition reimbursement but how do you go to college if you never know when you will be out of work.  Kind of tough to schedule classes around that.  

Big disconnect between what is taught in training and what goes on in the field.

The complimentary services (extended basic video and basic high speed internet) are great if you live in a Comcast serviced area. You save money since you will not have to pay for services for which you are probably already using.","Comcast production jobs: field technician support, general customer service, billing, retention, dispatch, telephony order management, and collections all had quotas which require the Comcast employees to process a certain minimum number of inbound calls, outbound calls, or repair trouble tickets within 5-8 minutes which can be unrealistic depending on the nature of the trouble or customer issue. The call center sales reps have only five minutes to sell video, telephony, and high speed internet services to each customer. Now, how can anyone explain the features and prices for three products in less than five minutes to customers who may not want to switch their telephone and internet services? 

When I was a telephony day of install agent, many times I had to wait for the EMTA (Embedded Multimedia Terminal Adapter), aka Comcast telephone box, to boot-up which could take 2-3 minutes thus cutting into my call quota time. Sometimes, I had to upgrade the firmware for the installed EMTA and that took 6-minutes. I know many of my co-workers would would perform incomplete installations to maintain their call quota times and production numbers thus many field technicians had to call back 2-3 times for troubleshooting help to complete their installations.

Due to the nature of Comcast's services, customer service related and field technician support related work is seven-days a week so forget about Saturday and Sundays off.

Do not count on job security. Comcast has outsourced telephony installation support work to the Philippines and they have transferred collections work from Livermore, CA to somewhere in Utah. The transferring of work outside California or outside the United States does not lower the cost of services to consumers or increase Comcast employee wages, rather the management decisions are to help increase investment returns to stockholders.",2011-02-02, Telephony Day of Install Agent

Also when calling off here, you don't have to fake that you are sick *cough *cough, or your great aunt is dead. You call in and tell your supervisor ""I'm not coming in today"" and that's it.

Working from home is also okay once or twice a week which is great! 
- Benefits and perks are great. Insurance is top notch and out-of-pocket is quite low. 401(k) matching is 6% which is amazing. Cable/internet/home security is heavily discounted and pretty much free
- Working with some of the brightest minds. Comcast tries it’s best to get some of the best engineers out there and it does show. Some of the people I work with have great ideas and can solve pretty much any problem. It’s great as an engineer still young in my career to take bits and pieces from how these people solve problems and make it my own.
- Great working conditions (in the Philadelphia campus at least). I love working at the Comcast Center (and moving to the Comcast Technology Center soon). Working in the tallest buildings in the city and getting the amazing views is pretty breathtaking and is a nice distraction when you want a break from your work. There’s also a nice cafeteria that has a lot of options albeit quite expensive. 
- Comcast is quickly becoming a top-tier technology company that’s developing and using some of the latest trends in tech. Comcast encourages their employees to try to incorporate new tools or develop a piece of software if it doesn’t already exist. 
- Even though people are starting to cut cable, Comcast has shifted it’s focus to internet and home automation/IoT and other spaces. This is a great move to continue to be a major tech player for years to come as cable television starts to die out.","- Stigma working at Comcast. Many people outside of the company still view Comcast as an evil telecom corporation. Telling people I work here can sometimes start a long conversation on how much they hate Comcast. 
- A bit lower salary than other top tier tech companies. Even though Philadelphia cost of living is way lower than Silicon Valley/San Francisco, I wish Comcast paid a bit more base salary, but it’s not that bad. 
- A lot of contractors. Even though many contractors are amazing and super intelligent, a lot of them come in and leave and there is a constant rotation. This can leave gaps in knowledge. I wish Comcast converted more people to FTE that really earned it.
- Promotions can take a long time depending on the org. Some orgs promote their top performing employees super quickly, others let their employees stagnate in the same role they’re in for years. 
- Things move SUPER slow at times due to how large the company is. To get a firewall request done could take up to a week which can be a little bit frustrating. Getting a new employee (especially contractors) set up with their laptop, desk, etc can sometimes take weeks after they start which is just ridiculous.

Recently Comcast has made a decision to convert their system over to CSG database which has caused a huge headache for many agents across the country because not only were we poorly trained on the new system but the system was flawed during its release which caused customers accounts to screwed up but we could not fix the accounts because we did not have the tools to fix the job. So we were simply told to lie to the customer to get them off the phone and write down the account and hope that you remember to fix that one account after handling over 40 accounts a day 5 - 6 days a week if you worked OT or not. Vacation, flex, floating, and sick days are okay but if you are working in the call center with this high level stress you are going to use them up faster than you got them. And if you live in an area where the weather does potentially get bad around the winter season you are advised to save your flex just for those days which is unrealistic because sometimes you do need to take some time off just to recoup from all the negative energy you encounter with the customers over the phone.

Good opportunities to earn lots of money if you knew how to sell products. Opportunity to earn overtime.,"Oh where to start... Management is a joke in some departments. To get a manager to take a escalated call is like pulling teeth at times. I went through multiple management changes in the almost 5 years I worked there. I have a few good managers and a few managers that I wanted to escalate every call I was on just to make her life difficult on purpose. The ability to grow in the company was extremely limited. You had to be either exceptional at your job or know someone to get promotions. The customers wear you down and down and down. You will get called names, cursed at, yelled at. They expect the worst customer service because that is what Comcast is known for but when you try to turn around their perceptions and over come their roadblocks it's like pulling teeth. So when it comes to call quality and their cqe's (listening to your call and getting reviewed by it) it feels almost impossible to meet all the expectations. Training is a JOKE! Yes, the initial training is good but once your on the floor trying to keep up with everything feels impossible so sometimes your calls take longer than they should because you're digging through information making sure that this customer is eligible or that the information you know is correct. When I was there every few months they would announce they would set aside training hours but then never would follow through. The mandatory overtime wears you down, an 8 hour shift getting turned into 9 or a 10 into 11 wouldn't seem like much but it can add up. There is really no significant raises after you're hired. It's based on your performance but I believe the cap is .30 cents. You are somewhat micromanaged if you aren't meeting goals in what ever they are pushing you can get into trouble pretty quickly. Coaching is non existent though. Managers will be the first to pipe up if you're doing something wrong but rather than give helpful hints or anything to help you grow they kinda leave it at that. I worked there for quite some time and I didn't meet my sales goal ONCE and my manager had the audacity to say to me why are we hiring you if you can't do the job. Managers play favorites with staff.  Also I HATED rate increases and explaining them to the customer was extremely hard at times.

Employee feedback is taken seriously.  Employee surveys result in action and change which has blown me away.

The culture at my center is all about learning, growth and delivering world class customer service.  Want to be a leader?  Learn to serve others.  Want to be on the phone?  We will help you be the best CSR ever.  Want to explore other options/areas?  We can make that happen.  As long as you are showing up and putting up your best effort, leadership will bend over backwards for you.

We are also making strides to simplify our processes and systems to make everyone's job (and the customer experience) easier.  There is an obvious commitment to fixing what needs to be fixed - it's not just lip service.  I have worked at other places that tout some new initiative or process and then let it fade away - that is not the case here.  I am thankful to see follow through on implementation such as NPS.

4327,4.0,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",Technician,"With the exception of a few techs which it doesn't matter where you go you'll run into those types in some fashion Comcast is a company that provides more benefits and tools to help it's employees in so many different aspects of not just work but home life as well at no cost. From financial advisors to serious discounts on Automobile purchases and insurance not to mention a nice 401k match and stock purchase program that gives employees stock at the lowest price for that quarter and a 15% discount on top which is accessible yearly. 
Employees basically receive TV, Internet and telephone for almost nothing. Roughly $300 services will run around $50-60 monthly.
You're given Roughly 64 hrs in flex time, 3 float holidays and over a weeks vacation time after your 90 days. They allow 6 call outs before a general counsel is given that a verbal is next, written, final etc. Call outs are 1-2 days on 3rd a note is needed. 
Doing your job correctly and having good numbers will go further than any amount of  favoritism as I've seen posted. You're supervisor will work with you through anything as long as you are keeping up your end.
As far as tools not being provided, Comcast gives you everything you need including $300 Red wing boots yearly, $800 for uniform purchases and you're responsible for ordering everything else that you will go through daily.  You'll also receive a new iPhone and tablet for work. 
I'm closing, you will take away from the basically 6 months of paid training what you put into it and your work ethic will determine your daily experience. Some days are beyond control but they're few and far. 
They also just added maternity leave for men up to 3 months I believe.","Rules vary from garage to garage like home garage.  Currently I believe Amazon drivers make more than a technician who’s been employed for over 10yrs. Closest competitors Technicians make more than double of that 10+ year tech after 5yrs less if hired with experience. 
I've seen a lot of other negative things about training, tools and support. I find those statements to be as far from the truth as possible and most likely made by people working as sub contractors for Comcast like ""Aero communications Inc "".
You do however have to consider the free services and benefits and what they might add to your check which is bi-weekly, I'm not a fan of that but that's more preference  than con. If you for some reason don't have direct deposit you'll receive a pay card that will get loaded every pay. 
Doesn't bother me personally but most days it's tough to take a lunch or you might be scheduled for lunch at 9:45am.

In all the companies I have worked for not one of them offers paid time off for when you are sick without it ALWAYS taking away from your Vacation time, and few have offered two weeks vacation in your first year. Comcast does not penalize you for having multiple children, no matter how many kids you have your insurance remains the same. People tend to get angry because they use all their flex (sick) time for pleasure and then get written up because they actually get sick and have no time left. I personally have needed to call out with zero notice twice since I've been with the company, and in neither case have I been written up. I think that the policy of calling out once in any rolling 30 days is completely rational, and of course if you don't agree with it you're tied to no contract so pack your desk and get out. Be greatful you have a job, you weren't guaranteed today, wake up glad you've got at least a few breaths left and take the call, that all be it miserable, is your call; look at the bright side you're getting complained to, or about, but knowing you did your best should be enough to satisfy you. Is it frustrating at times to work here, sure, but they call it work for a reason, I don't look at my wife and say ""I'm off to fun sweetheart,"" I say I'm off to work. So to wrap it up I'll say this is the job at times miserable, absolutely, but the main catalyst of this misery is employees that refuse to recognize a good thing when they have it. Comcast offers a great tuition reimbursment program, haven't seen much about that, two weeks PAID vacation in your first year, 8 PAID flex/sick days, and people complain, why, well simply put it's because they can't get their priorities straight. If you use a flex day for a hangover that's your ignorance, you knew you had to work the next day when you took that first drink, or stayed up late just to hang out and were too tired to work.

-Sweet office location, on 10th and 11th floor of building on 2nd/Madison.  In addition to all the nearby lunch spots (and bars) there is an outdoor terrace that stretches the entire south side of the building so you can soak up some sun and eat lunch why looking out at Mt. Rainier and the water.
-Bicycle Lovers!  Lots of folks ride/run/walk to work (I Bike) and it's really nice to have lockers, showers, a safe spot for bicycles to hang in the hallway (plus a bike cage on the bottom floor for those super sunny days when tons of people ride in).  Not to mention an active group of riders who get together for rides during lunch.

It feels good to only pay pennies on the dollar for cable, phone and Internet.  It is also refreshing to work for a company that makes such an effort to create and sustain an environment of inclusion and full representation of ALL people.  Comcast is an environment  where you can feel good about going to work everyday knowing that you will not need to conform to be successful, because the company WANTS you to be successful.  People are always willing to help and show you the ropes.  The Executive leadership at Comcast gets their hands dirty and generally know how to do the work of their subordinates  (it's expected ).  Further,  the ideas of new employees is welcomed and encouraged.  If you are not successful at this company it is at no fault of the organization.  I have heard the environment can be slightly different in remote locations (outside of Philadelphia headquarters). However it is also clear individuals that create hostile and uncomfortable type work environments are quickly removed.  You will rarely find an unhappy Comcast employee because any leader that leads by rule, exclusion, favortism, and intimidation is quickly  relieved of their duties in an effort to preserve the functional and productive culture and environment. 

It is rare to find such a large organization practicing these methods.  I feel very lucky to be part of this organization.  The company is growing which equates opportunity for everyone within the organization.

I heard they changed the commission structure just recently in 2013 and have been told that the earning potential is down, but for the skill required to perform the work you can make a whole lot of money. It required goal seeking personality, because you are your one and true motivation for success in this environment, and you will be put in positions which are very difficult to overcome, but if you do just grind out the work with enthusiasm and good work ethic you can do well for yourself.","It won't be easy making that money, and the greatest drawback is you have to consider the mileage, gas, and wear and tear on your car since it's on average with the people working there,  about  20k miles on your car per year.  I put about 20k in 6 months. When i worked out the math i saw that i was basically spending over $1,000 in gas per month for work expenses, not to mention car depreciation etc etc. I calculated it to about subtracting $10k to $15k from your total earnings to accommodate gas and wear and tear, which when i made $70k, 55k to 60k wasn't worth the difficulty of the position during the winter when people come home at 5pm and it gets dark at 6pm. you have to knock doors in the cold and in the dark untill about 7 or 8 pm, the cold you can deal with, but people in general are not receptive at door to door sales people, and in the dark it is a completely different animal. you may find an occasional person, but it is brutal going through neighborhoods in the dark knocking on their doors selling them cable. And if you don't then you have very little chance of making any commission. The summer time i found to be amazing, it got dark later, you had more time to make sales then, so my advice is summers you need to give it everything you have and then some, and plan your vaca's during the winter to give yourself some breaks during the toughest part of the year. If my sales would have remained consistent during the winter as it had been during the summer months i would most likely have stayed, but whether i was making sales or not, i was still spending the same amount on expenses.",2013-04-04, Anonymous Employee

Depending on where you end up the work atmosphere may be good too and there are a lot of good people to work with. It may be a good place to start your career as long as you don't stay there for too long.","The state of organization and management is beyond poor. It's such a big company that the left arm does not know what the right arm is doing. No matter what project you are working on, someone else somewhere in Comcast is working on a similar task, so you always end up competing internally against another group. There are always internal feuds going on throughout all levels of management with different branches of the organization fighting for control. Major re-orgs happen once a year, which only adds to the chaos.
No matter what you may think, Comcast is not a software company, and not even an engineering company. They are an operations company first and foremost. This trait is something you see throughout the cable industry because most people who work there came from support and operations and have little to no experience with engineering, architecture, and software projects. Because of the operations mentality the company has a very rigid culture of blame and shifting responsibility. When there is a problem, the first question is always not ""how do we fix it?"" but rather ""who can we blame for this?"" Additionally, because they are an operations-minded shop everyone is very resistive to change and it usually takes weeks to agree on anything or get anything done. Much of the management at this company make your average DBA look like a risk-taker.
The pay was crap, but I also know people who made good money there. The one common thing was that once you accept a job you don't get good raises or promotions, other than nominal title changes, and even those are hard to come by. So if you take a job make sure you ask for good money upfront and don't believe any promises of them ""taking care of you next year.""",2010-01-29, Software Engineer

The most common deceptions used by outsourcers are ""Try it free for 30 days and if  you dont like it you can go back to your previous promotion"" and their previous package will be alot less money so since Retention is commission based as well we cant return them to their previous promotion without hurting our numbers and our own paychecks. The second most common deception used by outsourcers and sales agents is that they will tell customers ""Oh the package is $99.99 with everything"" but they wont tell them that on top of that theres a $10 modem rental fee, each additional tv box is $9.95, HD is an extra $10, DVR is an extra $10, and taxes are extra and guess who has to fix the mess when the customer gets their bill? retention department. 

- By the time the customer gets to speak to the retention department they already spoke to at least 2-3 other departments who couldnt help them and each time they were screened by previous agents for adding more lines of business then handed off to another department like a hot potato if they cant get any sale from the customer which causes frustration and angry customers by the time they finally get to retention.

- To add a little more to my previous comment, retention agents are also responsible for adding lines of business but the customer is screened by previous agents that they spoke to before getting to retention to see if they can get any line of business sales from the customer so only the customers that they couldnt get a sale from get transferred to retention and retention then has to try to upsell those customers or give them the smallest discount possible if they dont want to add a line of business or disconnect them.

- Many agents refuse to help a customer at all if their account has Xfinity Home (home security) because they dont understand the product enough to help the customer so they usually just transfer them to Xfinity Home Retention even if all they needed was help with billing questions or if they wanted to make changes to their other services that werent home security.

- Retention is seen by other departments as the dumping ground to resolve customer issues even when a call isnt really a retention call, ive gotten billing agents that transfer accounts that are already disconnected (how is that a retention call?) to place some credits on the customers accounts because of billing errors but that waste my time because we only get commission on calls where the account is still active so thats time spent that you could be helping someone else who has an active account with the company.

- When an outsource agent or sales agent adds a line of business that the customer didnt want or ask for to their account the retention agent is responsible for removing that line of business but if the customer never agreed to add the service or was never informed that the agent was adding that service to their account how is that fair to the customer and the retention agent who takes a hit on their numbers? the most common cases right now are agents adding home phone or the cheapest home alarm package ($20 a month) via self install kit and the customer calls when they receive the equipment in the mail to ask why they received the equipment for a service that they werent aware they were getting then its the retention agents job to sell the value of the product that they never asked for or take a hit for the service and remove it from the account.

- Retention agents have to deal with sneaky people within the company sabotaging their retention efforts in order to get a sale for example its often the case where a sales person will create a new account in the new address where a customer moved to but that same sales person will then transfer the customer to retention department to disconnect the account at the previous address and not tell the retention agent that they created another account for the customer, the correct process is for the agent to transfer the account from the old address to the new one and disconnect the old account before connecting the new one but sometimes they dont disconnect the old account so that they dont have to spend more time with the customer on the line. This can affect the retention agents numbers because since the sales person didnt do their job properly if you dont know that the customer has two accounts you will disconnect an account that someone else was suposed to disconnect hurting your numbers. 

- Sometimes sales agents will collaborate with customers telling them that they should disconnect their account and then speak to them to create an account under their spouses name to get a new customer promotion so that they can get a sale which is unethical because their manipulating the system for personal gain at the expense of the company and other employees.",2015-07-09, Retention Specialist

Good benefits plan, although a few years ago, senior management did reduce the 401K match from 6% to 4.5% and they also discontinued the stock option plan in our dept. That was a big morale downer for the entire sales team.","1st level supervisors do the best they can, however senior management is so fixated on delivering stronger and stronger sales numbers that the job is nearly impossible to do if you truly want a satisfying work~life balance. Very poor customer service combined with many inept or lazy co-workers and even worse third-party vendors makes a tough job more difficult. Sales goals are unrealistic and the iCoMP system of reviewing/managing sales claims and pay verification is burdensome and time-consuming. It seems that the Sales Dept supervisors are spending most of their time filing reports and creating spreadsheets than actually doing what a sales supervisor is supposed to do - namely, to reduce/remove sales obstacles so the sales staff can get out to do what they do best.

Good commissions if you can sell.  28 Paid days off per year (pay based on full salary plus commissions--truly days off.)  Some decent contests and sales promotions.  Good supervisors can make all the difference.  I have a great supervisor.","To qualify my position for this review:

I'm a hero in my office.  I always make my numbers.  I always work 50+ hours a week, and I take my job very seriously.  I have a great supervisor (which makes ALL the difference.)  If you aren't up for lots of knocks on doors, lots of rejection and being watched--walk away from this job, it just isn't for you.  

Super high pressure sales job.  Two months of not meeting quota=no more job.  Upper management is completely disconnected with the sales force.  Expect to work in all weather--management will.  Unless there is a weather emergency, you are expected to work.  (Outdoors, knocking on residential houses for new business.)  Micromanagement to the max.  GPS tracking on your company supplied Ipad, all company supplied phone calls recorded, all customer contacts expected to be recorded.  If you don't like being monitored, this definitely isn't for you.   

Expect the whole office to know if you haven't made your numbers.  Management loves to shame those who are having difficulty.  Customer service for the purpose of referrals used to be expected.  Now it is forbidden.  The turn of the new year (to 2014) has shown lots of changes.  No more good promotions (incentives for the customers to buy from you vs. the call center where you don't get credit for the sale).  Higher deposits for new customers.  Cut in pay if you get a referral (not worth as much to the company, apparently)...so another reason to pay you less.  Commissions are frequently wrong.  More time out of your week to make sure you get paid correctly--expect it to be a battle.  The finance people look for reasons to pay you less, and they will if you let them.  

Overall--used to be a great job a year ago.  Not so much anymore.  

My personal opinion--Comcast is getting ready to end this division through two ways:
1.) Make it impossible for reps to reach quota, thus they didn't do their job.  Zero cost to eliminate that employee.
2.) Make the reps want to quit.  Even better for Comcast.",2014-03-11, Winback Direct Sales Representative

Very difficult job for new sales people, but no respect given to experienced sales people.
Impossible to earn what they say you can earn.
Penalized for being a good salesperson and getting referrals.
Upper management doesn't understand or care about having career sales people so turn-over is high and if you are half way competent they expect you to train the newbies for free.

This used to be a good gig where you could earn $40-$50K/yr without working too hard. Now with the new territory model it is impossible to earn above the base pay.

They will tell you the ""targeted compensation"" is $65K/year. Be sure to ask the recruiter how many reps in your area are actually making $65K? I'm guessing 5% and dropping.

If you don't mind knocking doors for 5 hours a day, and can live on $27K/year, heck you might as well give this a shot. The training pay is great and it will take them a month or so before they start writing you up for not making sales.

5210,5.0,Current Employee,Review,"I love working at Comcast. The benefits are great, the pay is fair, and the perks are a huge bonus.",I don't have too much to say bad. The biggest thing is the unknown. Since Comcast is a very large company in an ever evolving industry you never know what tomorrow will bring but that isn't always a bad thing.,2014-09-11, 
5211,2.0,"Former Employee, less than 1 year","All about the customer and the employee, until you get in the door.","Amazing benefits package. Accolade health assistance is an amazing service that will locate doctors and specialists for you, and they even offer your own personal nurse to offer advice on medical issues. Free cable and internet is nice, but you're still required to pay for the equipment.","First: In regards to the free cable and internet. Because you are an employee of Comcast and no longer considered a customer, any repair requests or changes that you may have, even if it's equipment related, which you are required to pay for can take several weeks to complete. Courtesy Services does not work quickly at all when it comes to employee repair issues.

Second: In regards to the job itself. I was hired for video repair. Now, I'm not idiot, so I assumed being a multiple service provider, some upselling and upgrading would probably be required, however, this is not the case. You don't find out until your SECOND day of employment (first day is orientation), which is your first official day of training that your primary goal is sales. It doesn't matter how mad the customer is, how many missed appointments they've had, or how many times they've flat out been lied to by other reps, you're still required to try to get a new line of service on them. An elderly lady calls you because her DTA ($1.99 basic cable box) doesn't work and says there's an interruption in service (more so than not, this means the box is bad and needs to be replaced), and while discussing the situation she happens to state she's on a limited income and can't afford a technician to come out and replace the box (free if it's the equipment, $39.95 if it's ANYTHING else), if you don't want it get scolded by management, you better try to sell her digital voice, or internet. She has a DTA? Better try to get her up to either a Digital set top box so she can get On Demand, or better yet, Just get her into an HD Triple Play package. I feel absolutely mislead about the job I interviewed and was eventually hired for. Had I known it was a driven primarily by sales, I never would have accepted the position in the first place.

Third: Career Advance Path (or, how to keep you in one spot until you can be replaced by trainees, because they trainees will be paid $11.00 USD per hour starting and can be easily replaced). This path was setup as a way to ""promote"" from within based on how hard you want to work and prove your worth to the company. You have 6 months from your hire date to go from CAE: Level 1 Representative to CAE: Level 2 Associate. This comes with a $1.00 USD pay increase. The problem with this are the metrics involved. While you are required to meet four of the metrics for promotion, I will focus on the three that are almost impossible. The first is TSRs, those are your sales, but not just sales. They have to be new lines of service. That means if someone only has cable, you better sell them internet, or phone. If you can sell a triple play, then you get 2 TSRs. You have to meet a percentage of 0.58% (absolute bare minimum) of sales on all of your total calls. On average, you can take 600 or more calls per fiscal month. 0.58% doesn't sound like much at all, especially over the course of 600 or more calls, right? Well that's 34.8 new lines of service. Now 600 is a high number. That would be on a very high call volume month. More accurately, you're probably going to take between 400 and 500 calls, so the number of TSRs required will raise or drop based on the number of calls you take per week, per month.

The next metric that really matters is called VOC: Voice of the Customer. Ever call Comcast and while you're waiting for a rep, the recording asks you if they can call you back to take a brief survey about your experience? That's what VOC is to employees. By default, you start at 100% monthly. Now, if you can maintain 100% per month, that pretty much just means that out of all of your calls, everyone opted out of that survey, so there was nothing to bring it down. While this survey is meant to be a way of the customer to give their opinion as to how I the representative helped you, most look at it as a reflection of the company, and oddly enough, we have a running slogan at Comcast, ""No one is calling to tell you how happy they are with the service"" and that's the truth. Unless during the survey, when given the opportunity, the customer actually records a voice message stating the rep they spoke to did an amazing job, anything negative that they report about Comcast directly reflects on the rep themselves, even if we successfully helped you. The customer is never made aware of this.

The final metric I want to discuss is called FCR: First Call Resolution. What this means to the rep is as follows. Say you're a Comcast customer and you're having issues with your video (since I only worked in video) and you call in and select the video option and get me. I have two options at my disposal. First and foremost, I want to troubleshoot the problem, because in most situations, the problem can be resolved by sending a refresh signal to your defective box (unless you have a DTA with a blinking light. If that light is blinking, you need your box replaced 9 times out of 10). After sending the refresh signal, we will ask you to disconnect the power to your faulty box for about 20 to 30 seconds then plug it back in. After a reboot process from the box, in most circumstances, your services will be restored. If these steps do not work, we have on other option, we send a technician out to your house. Now, we will tell you that if the problem is with the equipment, the service call is free, and this is true, however, the technicians have quotas to meet as well and more so than not, a tech will tell you there is a wiring problem and tell you that you either need to add a Service Protection Plan (Insurance for your cable lines that runs between $3.95 USD and $4.95 USD per month based on whatever market you're in) to prevent you from having to pay the $39.95 USD technician fee. If you don't want that option, we can then tell you to return the faulty box to a local service center (expect about a two hour wait) to replace the equipment, but if you bring that box home and it doesn't work, guess what? You now have something called a Failed Self Install, and regardless of your protection plan, it will not cost you $39.95 USD to have the tech come out and fix it.

Assume that I did fix your problem though, but you call back in 4 days later over a billing issue, if you either just hit 0 to talk to someone quickly in hopes of not waiting, you will get routed back to a repair department, if you happen to get video (we have a 7 day window before our FCRs are considered good and we're credited for them), but tell me on the phone that you need to get to billing. Through no fault of your own, other than wanting a rep quickly, you just caused me to get a negative mark on my FCR, simply because you came through on the video queue instead of going through the billing queue. Then, as an added bonus, I'm slapped with a negative transfer rate, because we're not supposed to transfer calls. When you combine just these three of the four metrics that we are required to meet for advancement to level 2 (you're terminated after six months if you've not attained three consecutive months of meeting and exceeding the four primary metrics. UNLESS of course, you have good sales and don't really do anything else. Then they're more than happy to break that rule for you and keep you on the phones with the promise of having you restart the Career Advance Path again for another six months.

Your shifts are not determined by seniority either. They are determined by sales alone. Those with low sales work the worst shifts, which basically means there is no such thing as ever seeing your family again if you wish to stay employed in a Comcast call center. Also...those metrics have to be met in order for you to even transfer to another department like Com tech, or dispatch.

ONE MORE VERY IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE: If you are a Comcast customer reading this and you demand to speak to a supervisor, there are two things you should know. We are required to do our best to prevent that transfer, even if it means telling you that they can't do anything different than we can. We are REQUIRED to de-escalate the call at all costs, even if that means lying to you to do so. Also, if you are one of the lucky ones that gets to a speak to a a supervisor, (this happens generally when someone has had several missed appointments by technicians, which by the way, get cancelled for no reason at all. Sometimes, they're cancelled, strictly because the tech didn't want to do the job that day, or could get something else done more quickly. When they tell you that you will receive a call 30 minutes prior to their arrival, you probably won't, but if they do call and you somehow miss the call, but call them back, they will not answer and they will move on to the next job. Your account will be marked as ""Cust Not Home""), you're probably not talking to a supervisor. More than likely you just got transferred to a rep just like me who tells you that he's a supervisor and then repeats the exact same thing that I just told you before the transfer. Supervisors do take calls from time to time, but it's only at designated times and only for a limited amount of time. Normally about an hour to an hour and a half. Just know, that if you're asking for a supervisor, more than likely the rep just put you on hold, leaned over to his neighbor (providing that the neighbor is authorized to take those calls) and says ""Hey, can you jump in iChat for a second, they need a supervisor"". Then we'll discuss over the partition everything that I just told you, so he knows what to say to you.",2015-01-12, CAE Repair

5291,2.0,"Former Employee, more than 10 years",The truth,"In all honesty, and I say this with NO malice, I have no ""pros"" to mention. I attempted to leave the field blank but was forced to input something.","My 16+ year experience at Comcast is bittersweet. I had such high-hopes at the beginning, expecting this to be a company which would want to develop, grow and empower its employees to reach their individual potentials. Sadly, this is not the case. There is no mentoring and there are no career paths. Management does not recognize the talents and gifting of its employees so they are rarely utilized. Everyone sitting in cubicles is under-utilized talent who are capable of so much more, but management is uninterested in encouraging personal development. 

As for the corporate culture, this took a drastic turn after the purchase of NBC Universal. Prior to purchasing NBCU, there are a fair amount of autonomy at individual locations and business practices had some flexibility to better serve the needs of customers. After purchasing NBCU, Comcast became overtly political and is now a company dominated by cultural relevance. Business practices are now top-down, one-size-fits all. The problem is, NOTHING is one-size-fits all and the customers suffer because of this. As an employee you will be exposed to, overwhelmed with and bullied by all of the cultural ""social justice"" issues of the day. 

Working at Comcast will not give you a personal sense of worth nor will it give you hope for your future. You will go to work each day and perform some tasks within a functional group however value will not be added to your life. The best you can hope for is to be blessed by a few personal relationships you are able to develop with some of your co-workers. This is what will sustain you. Over the last 4-5 yrs of my career at Comcast, my annual ""performance increases"" were a measly 2%. And I say ""performance increases"" because my annual reviews had nothing to do with my actual performance. Annual salary increases are determined during the annual budgeting process and understand that this company is ALWAYS looking for costs to cut. Costs associated with employees are always the first cuts made. Each year after the budget process is completed in Q3, headcount cuts are made in Q4. I was a witness to this the past 5-8 years.

If you seek ""job security"" then you will likely be able to find that at Comcast as long as you have no dreams or career aspirations. If you are someone who wants to make a difference or you want your hard work to be appreciated and rewarded then Comcast is not the place for you. Your obvious question to me after reading this is, ""Why did you stay there for over 16 years then?!?!""

They cater food often which is cool.  you are likely to get 2 weeks vacation as a new hire(3 weeks at 5 years 4 weeks at 15).  You get 8 flex days 4 floating holidays and point system which will allow you to come to work late/ miss days up to a certain point before being put on a final warning.  If they like you, they will not be quick to terminate you despite you violating the point policy or running out of approved time.  You get free cable service and free internet service with reduced rates on equipment.  You get half off  home phone service and discounts on certain cell phone carriers.  The stock plan is steadily growing. I advise to get in get experience and move on to a better position within the company such as sales support, administration, REM, or become a trainer. Also they have 100% tuition reimbursement which I loved, so use it.","This is not a job for the weak of mind or weak of heart.  It's a true sales environment so you will experience multiple quotas and demands to be met at once, as well as the expectations of what is the most important quota will change drastically according to business and you may rarely be told why the fluctuation is occurring.  There will be favoritism  and gossip, sexual harassment from management, your sales commission being shorted with no logical explanation or logical math to to show how they calculated your commission or lack there of.  Customers can be extremely rude often to no fault of your own but usually because another rep or department dropped the ball big time.  Inter department communication is poor, so customers get bounced around a lot causing them to be moody.  You will be tempted to avoid taking calls, transfer customers to other departments to avoid dealing with their irate behavior, hang up on customers, lie to customers, slam customers as well as steal sales from other reps who have likely stole sales from you.  But I urge not to do anything unethical as that  is a quick way to be fired or put on a final warning.  However, don't be surprised to see management openly rewarding other reps that do these things to hit their numbers but pretend they don't know how the rep made such outrageous quotas.  Instead be honest with yourself and sup and take a break when you get fed up, get your sales honestly, get your check, and  try to move up to something less stressful.",2014-09-21, Inbound Sales Representative

From the engineering side there is great opportunity if you have the skills required.","Within the past 6-9 months the energy, morale and camraderie has gone out the window. I understand we are all struggling through tough economic times but if you look at the cash flow Comcast is bringing it it hardly seems to warrant the degree of ""restructuring to achieve financial efficiencies"" that has been occuring. For those of you who don't know what this means in real terms, the translation is eliminated jobs.

If you're in the dispatch department, it's like the pit of doom. There is no advancement, floor support was taken away despite the need for it. It's hard to get out of that department and I've been trying for a year.I actually think I had a better chance of advancement as a customer service rep than in the dispatch department. The entire department is a dead end. 

Also in the dispatch department, as a fulfillment specialist (a fancy word for tech support for techs), there is actually no real way that we are measured as far as stat wise. We haven't had score cards in nearly a year and even though it sounds fine, it means that they don't have any real way to measure you when its time for evaluations for raises so they give you all average scores when you've actually done better in reality. 


The pay for the dispatch department is a laugh and the bumps in pay are next to nothing.

- Co workers were a joy to be around
- Immediate Supervisor was quite possibly the best mentor one could ask for in a ruthless industry such as  
  cable/telecommunications
- Location was perfect for those moments where I had to take an early break to release the arduous  amounts of stress (Mountain air and views)
- Immediate Supervisor pushed the team based on our unique ways in handling complex situations and motivated us on an individual basis. This was a strategy that worked because it was not rooted in dollar amounts.
- Generous 401k company match 5% and EXCELLENT benefits with regards to health and perks","The challenges in this job were absolutely soul crushing...
- Inbound phone calls from the most ruthless and ridiculous customer base I have ever worked with
- Metrics were increasingly absurd in how it measured sales as the number one factor when the job was about retaining customers who were intent on cancelling their subscription (I understand the business idea behind this but the metrics were far and away from the reality of things)
- Rampant unethical behavior in the Sales department forced Retention agents (including myself) to fix accounts rather than focus on saving business. However, upper management either didn't care or did not want to address the problem. This in turn led to rampant turnover rates and fostered a sweep it under the carpet mentality
- Encouragement was through dollar amounts rather than actually helping customer's fix their obvious account issues. Overseas billing could not quite understand their own systems let alone company wide information. This brings me to my next point......
-COMPLETE LACK OF INTERNAL COMMUNICATION. I cannot stress enough that the main reason in which I was utterly exhausted everyday stemmed from the constant battle that took place with customers on the phone. It almost always centered on false promises by previous billing and sales reps or advertising that was NOT consistent. Beyond frustrating.
- Mediocre pay in the grand scheme of things due to high tax rates on monthly commission checks. Comcast has no control over the reps being taxed like it's a bonus but the company purposefully does this in order to not shell out too much money to its employees.

Over 17 employees and a few supervisors were on final warnings, but in the first 4 or 5 years, you basically had to do something stupid or fail a drug test... in other words you had to fire yourself.  Also you only report to your supervisor, so if you get stuck with a control freak.. you may not last long.  To top all of that off, the stress levels at the job only get worst with time... while still having to meet the needs of the customer.  Lastly, it's a communications company that fails to communicate.  Sometimes you learned more about new services and products from customers than from management and higher ups.

	Decent pay for the type of job

Bad company reputation.  Much of it deserved.  The steps they are taking may not be enough to overcome that.  Too little too late. 

They do not listen to front line employees even though they give lip service to it. 

Industry in huge state of evolution and flux – seems unsure of direction/longevity.  Cord cutters, market saturation, major competition, popularity of online streaming originals etc.  Comcast seems to be throwing things at a wall and seeing what sticks. 

Cannot apply for other internal opportunities for a year. 

It is ALL about your stats and metrics (Scorecard).   To higher ups, you are just a number on a report. 

Pushed constantly to sell, sell, sell.  Try upselling a customer who is calling you because their current services aren’t working right in the first place.  They just laugh (often literally ) at you.  Or it just makes them more upset.  And it is REQUIRED of all reps.

No benefits or time off while in training and residency (first 90 days) and very strict about time keeping and schedule adherence.   Understandable, but life happens too.  If you need schedule flexibility, tons of work/life balance – call center is NOT the job for you. 

Comcast University training does not prepare you fully in any way for everything you encounter when you really go out on the floor to take live calls.   Not even close. 

Internal technology and trouble shooting system shockingly awful and difficult to manage.  Constant glitches, bugs and crashes.  Yet you are told to always trust these tools and the info they are giving and must demonstrate you used them.   Not sure even Bill Gates himself or the late Steve Jobs could understand order building – ugh.  

Lack of consistency in enforcing professional standards as far as behaviors out on the floor.  ie - dress code, eating at desk, etc.  Seems if your sales numbers are good you can get away with murder otherwise.

5699,3.0,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Soul-killing, but at least it's a job","Above minimum-wage pay, some health benefits (but not really the pay to be able to use them), lots of overtime available.","Corporate thrives by deliberately keeping call center employees confused about the latest pricing (which also makes it very easy for an employee who thinks he/she is following the latest dictate to be fired at any time), life is ruled by ridiculous quotas out the wazoo (and failing to meet any of them can also lead to job dismissal at any given time).

This is a job where literally every second of your day at work can be and is electronically monitored -- this is because you ""punch in"" to the work day by logging in to your telephone headset. Computers track in real time not just for your immediate supervisor but across the call center how long you are on a call with every single customer (if you go over a certain time while helping a customer and your supervisor arbitrarily decides today is the day to crack down on that you will receive an IM about it in real time to get off). Your breaks thus are logged and monitored in real time down to the second. The calls are back-to-back from the time of your first phone call to the last. There are people who do not believe there are such Orwellian jobs or technology yet where an employee's ""productivity"" can be monitored in real time by the second and acted on, but anyone in service-industry type jobs just above the fast-food level or big-box-store level knows this is very much the reality (warehouse employees for online sellers, for example, also are tracked for their productivity from the moment they electronically check in through every single item they scan and package and how many seconds it takes them to reach another bin, etc.). All of this is before you even get to the ridiculous quotas, also monitored and tracked in real time electronically, but many other posters already have hit on that. Your corporate identity is 100 percent numbers 100 percent of the time. But at least it's a job.

The single most frustrating thing is that Comcast issues deliberately contradictory pricing information to call center employees and that it provides a single day of training on troubleshooting and resolving issues that 99 percent of customers calling into the call center are trying to resolve (one day out of two months of training is devoted to troubleshooting; the rest is devoted to sales). The contradictory pricing information and constantly changing basic Comcast corporate policies are not just bad communications -- they are deliberate. The contradictory information means that any given customer calling in will get a different answer on pricing from every single person he/she speaks to, and it's totally a crapshoot whether the person seeking help with the service will actually have the issue resolved. The contradictory information often flies in the face of what even the supervisors of the front-line call center employees might have repeatedly said is the policy over the course of a year -- literally overnight front-line call center employees and their supervisors will learn that what they've been doing all along to follow the rules and keep their jobs isn't just a little bit different than what the corporate policy really is but 100 percent the opposite, and a bunch of coworkers in one fell swoop in one day will be fired to underscore the seriousness of their infraction. I don't know why upper management operates in such a way -- there will always be a few longtime devoted great employees caught in the mass firings -- but it almost has to be budgetary (the call center needs to make its own quotas) and arbitrarily overnight changing policies and saying that's been the policy all along allow the company to cite a reason for an abrupt mass firing. The employees really are just endless set of numbers and mathematical calculations on a computer screen.

5701,3.0,"Current Employee, more than 8 years",Great company that lost site of its employees,"Very good benefits, reduced rates for cable products, offices everywhere if relocation is an issue","Over the past 5 years Comcast has looked at the bottom line regardless of facts. A couple of examples: Customer Service agents have their phone calls monitored for time and count. Supervisors look at these (among other) numbers to determine if employee is meeting the days numbers. No where does it record if problems are actually solved. WAY too often the agents rushes people off the phone without correcting a problem that would have taken them beyond the expected time limit. This infuriates customers as anyone who has Comcast can attest. The agents who take the time to make sure the problems are corrected go over the limit, don't get as many calls completed and, without recourse, get denied a raise.
The Technicians have it much the same way. A tech is given an average of 60 minutes to go to a house, identify the problem and correct it. Oh yes, and check everything else in the house to make sure the customer does not have to call again for a repeat trouble call. In a new construction home, this is fine. In a 50 year old home with old wires that need replacing, the job could take four hours. Do it right.....no raise. Do it fast, customer calls back and the Tech gets a repeat....no raise.
Comcast recently had many long time employees in Customer Care ( many supervisors) have to re-apply for their jobs. Many did not get re-hired. The environment is one that, even most supervisors, feel that every day could be their last. It is an extremely stressful job at every level. A few years ago the numbers guy in our office actually asked the technicians how long it took to walk from their morning meetings to their trucks. Really?????

Ask the right questions!,"Excellent medical benefits, courtesy services, 401k plan with immediate 100% vesting and matching,  uncapped commissions, nice salary, promotion possibilities throughout huge company","Be ready to be ""owned"" by the company.  The companies sales process is so extremely dysfunctional that it takes hours and hours out of your day instead of selling.  This truly creates a 60-70 hour work week.  On top of that, the front end sales numbers (I.e., prospecting and cold calling) is enormous (25 initial appointments per month with clients you have never met with before).  This is Enterprise also, so the MAJORITY of people you contact would not have a need for Enterprise-level products.  Management is high pressure and in my experience uses bullying tactics and fear mongering in order for people to work harder.

The reality is in the numbers.  When I was there (18 month tenure), there was only around 4-5 out of 27 reps that were at quota (!!!).  That is a terribly low number of reps making quota, considering that the sales force is comprised of very smart people, most of whom has 10++ years of sales experience.  Simply not acceptable.

Comcast is so huge that they lost their eyes completely on customer service.  They create issues with their horrific\bizarre\dysfunctional sales process and stick their customers in the middle of it.  Guess who gets the calls?  The EAE gets to come along and clean up the mess and try and justify why their company can't seem to get anything straight.

Scrutiny for try to take care of the customer - if it was necessary to call a customer back for any reason, and the callback lasted more than 10 minutes you may have people coming to ask why you are not ""available,"" or getting emails the next day asking you to explain why your total ""outbound,"" time for the day exceeded their goal.


The company stopped putting any faith into troubleshooting abilities of their agents and mandated use of a line-of-questioning as the only way we were allowed to help customers. Essentially you become an interactive script and even if you can see in your notes or diagnostics what the customer's issue is, you are not allowed to simply take the proper step to fix it, you must ask the customer irrelevant questions and fill out the ticket. You are no longer able to even send a simple refresh signal to a piece of equipment without ""permission,"" from their line-of-questions system. This system was full of bugs and feedback and bug-reporting were ignored for months at a time, only then to receive a stock reply of ""we are working on it,"" or the ticket being rejected as a ""duplicate,"" but with no resolution. Despite the amount of time you were forced to waste in this system, the metric of how long you can have a customer on the phone for was never adjusted to compensate.

The system essentially nullified any need for training as anything you learned in training was no longer useful - you could only say and do what was on your screen. You essentially become an automated system with slightly better voice recognition. I truly believe the overall goal of this is to reduce training costs. Before this system, new agents spent six weeks in training. Comcast call centers have a huge turnover rate, so the cost of training is fairly significant. Eliminating the need for training, even at the cost of a far, far, inferior customer experience seems to be preferable. This will make employees more expendable and help with costs related to the turnover rate. No competent person stays at Comcast long because the pay is not worth the environment and the way you are treated. I think it's very sad Comcast thinks this is a better solution than fixing the things that make people quit and hiring competent people who can troubleshoot effectively without literally being told what to do, step-by-step, real-time.

While paid time off seemed generous, the fact that an unscheduled absence for *any reason,* was considered ""unacceptable,"" offset that significantly. T-Boned on your lunchbreak? Unacceptable; point. Death of a close family member who does not meet their strict criteria of ""immediate?"" Unacceptable; point for any time missed as a result. They give you what they call ""flex-waives,"" which, in reality, are what other companies call ""personal days."" The difference is they are used as excuses to not waive any absence for any reason beyond those 4 ""flex-waives, regardless of what documentation and you may have and regardless of the situation.

It is normal to take the unfavored shift when starting with an employer, but at Comcast, I was stuck with it. 1-Midnight, including weekends. Despite the fact that their was a shift bid 5 months after we started, we were not allowed to participate. My numbers were good and I looked forward to getting a more manageable shift. They were using 3 months of scorecard data to calculate rank. While we had 3 months of data, the range they defined included one month for which we were not on the phone. It would have been very easy to slide that date range to let us participate in the bid. There were a number of ways to let us participate, but they chose not too. Seniority is only 30% of the bid, it is supposed to be based on performance  but despite being a top-performer I was stuck for a year working 1pm-Midnight because it was easier for them logistically.

Benefits were quite expensive compared to other Fortune 500s and for slightly worse coverage.

Many promised benefits were not possible to take advantage of. They supposedly have a system where Comcast will pay for certain IT courses and you pay for the testing to get a certificate. This was a key point for me in my interview, and it was glorified during training when they indoctrinate about how amazing Comcast is. For 3 months I tried to coordinate taking advantage of this program, I involved multiple supervisors, a manager, and they worked with HR. Supervisor and manager had never heard of it, I sent screenshots of the company intranet discussing exactly how to take advantage of it, they worked with HR, and nothing ever happened. I was emailing often to check on progress and simply getting the run-around, it was completely impossible to use.",2014-10-20, Technical Support

5728,2.0,"Current Employee, more than 5 years",Feeling discouraged and not valued as an employee,"Internet/tv packages if you are lucky enough to live in the Comcast footprint. If not, you have no access to this huge benefit. The medical bene's are good and a huge reason why I stick with the company. 401K 6% match is nice. And a good employee stock program. Free tickets to Universal is mute for me, I don't live near there nor will i pay a plane ticket to go there. Time off benefits are nice, you start with 80 hrs. of vacation and 40 hours of flex, plus 3 floating holidays. When you hit your 5th year, you get an extra 20 hours of vacation. But then sadly no more ever again.","My original job with Comcast was outsourced, and my and many other people's positions were eliminated. We were told we had 1 year to get back into the company and still maintain our standing with the company. My last day was august 17th 2017, and i was hired back in on October 15th 2017. My medical benefits did not automatically turn back on like i was told by HR they should. I spent 3 months being ignored by HRSS on getting my medical benefits reinstated. Big mess up on them having me in the system as a ""new hire"" which wasn't the case. The fact i was ignored for 3 months was the biggest of that issue. It was December 29th when they finally contacted me to tell me they messed up. I had been contacting them weekly since being rehired. 

 I also expected the yearly merit raise when March 2018 rolled around, based on the 10 months I worked in 2017. But found out that because I was forcedly ""displaced"" for 8 weeks, it made me ineligible for a raise. How convenient for Comcast. This makes me furious, disappointed, discouraged, feeling unvalued and financially struggling currently with the lack of over time options at my new job and a $210/mo. rent hike. 
* Shame on you Comcast. I worked my butt off for 10/12 months in 2017, I worked harder than many, and I cared more than most. I'm one of the great employees this company prides itself on having, and they use a lousy loop whole to not honor my yearly raise? I did not LEAVE, I was forced out so they could save $$ by sending the jobs to another company who’ll do it cheaper.  I'll be honest, that alone makes me care a whole lot less, and why should I care for a company that doesn't care for me? Their excuse was ""you were not with the company for those 8 weeks. My counter was ""but what about the 8 months leading up to that? That effort should have been acknowledged.  And the 2 months after it when I re-hired? None of that is counted? My 8 months of back breaking labor doesn't matter to them. And their excuse for the 2 months after was ""new hires that start in October are not eligible for a merit raise"" ... Yes, I am aware of this. It is true because they are within a 90 day new hire trial period, so no they wouldn't get a merit raise for that calendar year. BUT I'M NOT A NEW HIRE! I’m a rehire, and I did work during the calendar year and I was NOT in a 90 trial period. How convenient you relabeled me just in this regard so as to not have to give me my well DESERVED and most certainly earned raise.  Screwed me over is what you did. I'm sure all your employees with poor work ethic still got their raise. I owe the company at least 10 months of lack of effort, but it’s not my way, I just have too good of work ethic. I just need to be with a company that truly honors that and wants to retain the good employees. My raises have been anywhere from 4%-6.5%, (5% being the max we were told) I’m really that great of a worker. My entire management team gave me glowing letters of recommendation because they wanted to make sure the company retained me. And then the company slaps me in the face, again.  What would a lousy minimum 2% for me have cost them really? I would have taken that over nothing. SHAME SHAME SHAME on Comcast. 
They offer poor chiropractic care in their medical package. Comcast is filled with people doing heavy lifting, bending, twisting, back hurting jobs, whether a tech, a warehouse employee, or someone sitting at a desk for 8 hours, real chiro care would be great but sadly we only get 12 visits. If you are unlucky enough to have to use any of those visits before you hit deductible you'll  be paying about $45 a visit, and then after you use up 12.. You’ll be paying $45 a visit… So try to hit deductible before you need chiro-care.  
Another con is, sometimes management doesn't want to deal with, handle, manage, the troublemaker employees. Maybe they are scared to? But sometimes some management will make a martyr out of a good employee because they don't want to reprimand a bad one. It's sad, I’ve seen it a lot unfortunately. 
In the office setting there is a very cliché ""clique"" scene. I came from warehouse, and get some grief for having not been with in this building before getting hired in this position. As if I am any less capable of doing this job. And honestly, I do it better already than some of the old timers here who have gotten to the point of laziness and lack of care. 
After your 5th year you will not receive any more extra vacation time. Sad, I know lots of people who've been here for 20 years and get nothing for it, not even a real raise because they are ""capped"" I think they get a onetime bonus each year for time served. 
Speaking bonuses, they gave us all $1000 bonus after they got a HUGE tax break from Trump. That bonus was taxed so hard, that the government still got theirs, and Comcast got to save on theirs, and i didn't get a raise, and that lousy $450 bucks was pointless and did NOTHING to help the employees or the economy in which we live. Thanks for nothing on that front. Didn't even cover half of rent. 

Most of the places won't let you use your flex time as needed. It's your time and you get punished constantly for having to use it, Vacation should be scheduled, Flex should be able to use freely *within reason*. We fought for that at the warehouse and got it but now my new position is a big NOPE. All my work is finished for the day, even if there is plenty of coverage and we're all twiddling our thumbs, if you have to leave early, you're getting punished. Forget to log into the phone after lunch, get punished. Come in 3 minutes late, punished. I could have just gone to Tim Hortons, grabbed breakfast, been 2.5 hours late, and had the same punishment. I'll remember that next time if traffic is stupid and I’m not going to make it within that 1 minute 59 second grace period. 
It doesn't matter if you work through my breaks, I stay late if its needed,  go above and beyond, get all of your work done, help others theirs done, you get punished right and left for using flex time, OUR TIME, without a 24 hour notice. Heck, I came into work and at 9am I asked to take the next day off because something came up last minute, (my shift starts at 8:30 mind you) the 23.5 hour notice wasn't a 24 hour notice.. I got punished. I needed to take a weekend off, but felt bad because of the already light coverage and didn't want the other ladies to be swamped, so I chose to come in for a couple hours anyways to help out. Had an issue in the morning, got there late, stayed later to make sure all the things were done, and got punished. Next time I’ll just take the whole day and not try to be nice. It only bit me in the behind in the long run. This is definitely getting old.
I'm giving Career Opportunities a 1 star, because you could be perfectly qualified for a job and get denied without reason, and then the job will go back up on the board as open. Come to find out, I have been told multiple times “we don’t hire outside the building, you are a rare case” Why don’t you hire outside the building? Is this how all the establishments with in Comcast operate? How do we move up if all you see is Warehouse, or Driver and immediately assume we’re too stupid or unskilled. I’ve seen it happen too many, they get stuck in these entry level positions and it actually HURTS them. You think you are getting a foot in the door, but really you are getting stuck in the room. 
The ONLY reason I was even considered was because of being a great employee, and the right connection seeing it firsthand put a word in for me. They have this mentality of “if you didn’t start in this office there’s no way you could do this job”. Let’s be clear, this job is EASY. At least for myself it is, I see people who’ve been here for 20 years struggle with concepts or not catch on as fast to new content as I have. I have BFA, I am computer/tech savvy, I can learn any new software or program within a week or 2. I have common sense, and logic. I have experience in this kind of work. I’m smart, motivated, self-managed, and a shining example of good work ethic.  But I was almost not even given the time of day because I wasn’t with in this building? Then don’t post the jobs on the company’s open job listings.",2018-06-30, Analyst

5779,2.0,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",Comcast Technician,The money starting out is ok and you max out around 30 dollars an hour. The benefits are decent.,"It now takes 6 months to a year to move up each level to get more money as oppose to the 1-6 months it use to take to move up each level. The metrics you have to meet to move up have become very high as well plus your supervisor has to like you enough to feel you are ready to move up. They are still in the business of rushing their technicians to make time frames and have high production with ""good"" quality which leads to a lot of skipped breaks and sometimes even a half lunch if we get one at all. If you do work there, gain the favor of the boss and just mimic what they do if they were a technician even if it is not with the best interest of the customer. Its about finishing out jobs quickly here, not so much customer satisfaction.You don't have days off as well since if someone calls in on you for whatever reason, even if not cable related, you get a bad mark on your metrics therefore making it harder for you to move up. They claim they do not count it against you, if it is not workmanship, but they do. This makes it harder for you to make your metrics and in turn harder to get paid more. When you reach your higher amount of money as a technician you have to befriend management to keep your job long enough to get fired before retirement which I have seen them do to older technicians. Tech's are just numbers to them, literally. We have technician numbers with metrics beside them. The technicians that I have heard of that did that were actually good were let go for whatever reason they may have seen fit. Good tech's, good people. Just not up to the speed of what the company wanted. If you look up Comcast under Forbes, they are the worst known for customer satisfaction in 2014 and being a tech there, I can see why unfortunately. Everyone in the middle are less stressed, but underpaid for the work they do so if they are ok with the smaller pay then it is a little more stressful than the worst or the best technicians. Management looks at the poor customer satisfaction and lack of quality work done on the first visit as ""job security"". Not really customer driven at all unless a customer complains, especially on You Tube. I only stay here because the money is good enough, but the customer loyalty and the opportunity for growth for good tech's are lacking. This is a high stress job when you are doing really good and when you are doing bad.

There are multiple formulas they use to grade you.   repeat rate, service on install rate, on time rate,  customer survey rate etc...    
Lets say you go to a customers house and the house is up to BRIS standards.  The customer keeps having ongoing issues with the comcast phone service.  You check everything and find no issues.  you leave.  customer calls back in a couple days to report issue is back again... guess what, YOU get penalized for that.   These add up and determine your raise and promtions at the end of the year.  Even though the customers house is up to BRIS standards and evertyhing checks out ok and you know the neighborhood is a constant problem that ends up being a system capacity issue GUESS WHAT, it's still your fault and you get dinged and those numbers affect your performance review, your pay, your status.   Turnaround is pretty high. There is ALWAYS new hires coming in.  This job is very misleading in the job description and interviews.... You think you will be going to people houses and showing them how to work the internet and tv and laugh and have a good time BUT you are really racing there because you are in a timed window and if youre late, youre in trouble with your numbers.  Then you need to check the oustide for correct wiring, ground, fittings etc... then you need to check the split point for correct fittings and signal THEN you need to check Every outlet for fittings and issues THEN you fix the issue from the customer calling in. ..... hope you can figure out how to do all that fairly quickly and without error.  You get two 16 ounce bottles of gatorade once a week to help keep you hydrated.  The Corporate monkeys only care about numbers on paper.

5816,3.0,Current Employee,Good for growth of your skillset.,"The perks of Comcast include:
Free cable, internet, and phone. Hands down one of the best job perks you can get as a 9 to 5 employee in the country. 

The corporate environment varies, but for those where there is a more relaxed attitude (i.e. no business casual required, creature comfort perks, more freedom to interact with your managers, etc) the experience is very pleasant and rewarding. 

Skillset growth. Comcast is willing to bring in new technologies, strategies, and business mindsets to see what succeeds without hesitation. While it without a doubt means that there is a ""throw it all at the wall and see what sticks"" management style, it definitely means you can pick up new talents and marketable skills on the fly. 

People. Of all the places I have been at, I have enjoyed my coworkers the most at Comcast. Maybe its because its the cable/entertainment industry or if its just the type of people it attracts, but in general its difficult to not get along with the majority of people they have in any office.","Accountability, or lack thereof for management above a certain level. Its a pretty well known fact that in Comcast it takes quite a bit to get yourself fired/removed once your at a certain management level, no matter how bad the screw up is. It can be demoralizing for employees in a division to see well laid plans blow up in their faces because of some boneheaded decisions from above and not see any repercussions from it. 

HR tends to let talent slip away. Personally, I have seen some absolutely brilliant minds and talent leave comcast because there were either too slow to attempt to keep the employee or unwilling to pay the employee their market value in the face of competition. This will be a very big problem for them for the foreseeable future. 

Over reliance on contracted workers. Comcast likes hired help. Way too much. From installers, office workers, coders, and support staff Comcast will always bring on an army of contractors before they will even consider a full time hire. The consensus is pretty much the same for them all, the work isn't as good and they tend to be unmotivated to improve the company for a lack of motivation or ownership of one's work.",2014-04-13, Operations Specialist
5817,3.0,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",Financially stable company to work for,"As a Direct Sales Rep, you are allowed great deal of autonomy and great pay.  Comcast pays a lot more than other telecommunication companies for the direct sales position. 
I My love my immediate supervisor and really like my team members.  It is a very relaxed atmosphere and great place to make a career.
Great benefits package (Health, Dental, Vision, Prescription, Short term/Long term disability, Supplemental insurance, life insurance, 401 k, discounted stock options, multiple stock options, discounted cable, discounts towards Universal Studios tickets, etc.)  They match your 401 k contributions up to 4.5% of your income which is outstanding.  
Also, very generous holiday, vacation, flex, floating holiday and other time off schedule.    Full time employees start with 1 week of paid vacation (based on your previous years earnings to calculate your hourly) after the first 90 days of probation.  After 5 years of employment, it will increase to 2 weeks and up to three weeks after ten.  
Also, in my experience race, gender, etc. does not play a part as most of the my team members and immediate higher ups are considered to be minority.  
I believe that Comcast genuinely cares about its employees.  They are always asking, surveying how they are doing and what can be done to foster a better atmosphere.  There is an open door policy and all employees have access to HR and Comcast Listens which allows for anonymous whistle blowing or sharing of other concerns.","Comcast is too big for its own good.  The right hand does not know what the left hand is doing.  Even though each department has put emphasis on their own teams, they do not communicate and cooperate effectively with other departments to streamline the processes and offer better internal/external customer service experience.
Even though are sales channel is paid generously, the same cannot be said of other departments which could lead to low employee morale and performance.  This explains why Comcast  consistently ranks on the bottom of JD Power customer service rankings for telecom providers.
Also, most of Comcast's training is via Comcast University which is done online by the employee.  Even though virtual setting has its advantages (cost/resources), it fails to adequately prepare some employees for their specific job.  For example, in the sales arena, there are a million online modules that will teach an employee about tech., brand, etc. but fail to teach actual sales training.

You typically get an extremely good discount on services.

Working conditions tend to be pretty good unless you're one of the poor guys who happens to be out in the field on a horrible weather day (keep in mind 100 degrees can sometimes be worse than cold and wet).

Good ability to move around to other positions and good ability to move to other parts of the country if desired (although more difficult to move up strictly by way of superior performance alone).

While there are options to Comcast's services, at the moment they are typically poorer ones, resulting in fairly good job security so long as you're a fair to solid performer. More competition is on the horizon, however Comcast is often a step ahead.","Appearance of function is often more important than actual function, both internally and externally.  Statistics are fairly easily manipulated if you know how.

Too often localized management displays rather short term business behaviors in trying to shine for upper local or centralized senior corporate leadership (Philly). Those in higher positions of power often have little idea of how things really work locally and on the front line, but think they do and those under them are often either ignorant themselves or simply to scared to correct them, resulting in the implementation of negatively impacting policies as a result. Even if local or senior leadership do confer with local or front line employees they rarely listen and typically move forward with their ideas, or those of their superiors, regardless. It's hard to say if this is out of arrogance or a mistrust that the employees aren't being honest with them. Speaking up about such issues is often ignored outright or can result in someone being labeled a bad employee, even so far as being targeted to get rid of (and HR will often not have your back in such a case since it's that persons superiors who have their ear).

Internal policy often drives negative employee behavior. Front line employees are often given conflicting goals. For example, in tech support our employee reviews are negatively impacted if we send a technician to a customers home as compared to correcting the issue over the phone, providing us with a reason to not help customers that need in-person support requiring a truck roll.  Tech support reps often find ways to get the customer to call back rather than schedule an in-person service call in order to pass the known needed truck roll on to another tech support agent.  This is one of the various reasons customers have to call multiple times to get the help they need.

Outsourcing aspects of the service, sometimes even internal support, is causing problems that are being ignored too long for the sake of saving money on paper or, if money is actually being saved, it's only in the short term. Customer service suffers for the sake of saving a little money and in the long run money will be lost due to bad customer service.  With the increase in cell phone usage and the advent of internet based entertainment this will become a bigger liability in the near future.

Benefits, while still good, have been getting reduced over the years. Higher end medical plan options have repeatedly been done away with over the years and 401k match dropped a several years back. Yet Comcast makes higher (record) profits every single year. Perhaps this is why?

You need to be a Yes-Man in order to move up. Even if your criticisms are legitimate there's rarely any point to voicing them. While middle management is somewhat to blame for this it can be argued the reason they don't try is because they are often stuck in the same situation with their local superiors. In most chains of command at Comcast you'll often run into someone who is afraid to rock the boat for the greater good of the company due to the fear of drawing attention to the fact that things aren't quite as rosy as people been painting them to be. As a result you will likely draw the, often silent, ire of your superiors by speaking up.

Surprisingly, for one of the worlds largest communications companies in the world, Comcast needs to update their measuring stick for how the company is gauged.  Television subscribers are still largely considered the primary focus, yet other services are more profitable.

Unfortunately, none of this is all that unusual in a corporation as large as Comcast, however the problems seem more magnified at Comcast based on my knowledge of other companies.",2016-03-06, Support

For instance, the first day of training we received lots of GOOD swag, and invited to subscribe to all their services for a huge (almost free) discount. This is so employees can speak about the products knowledgeably. What a savings in a monthly budget! The training pay was $20.43 per hour, and then reduces to $12 per hour plus commission. The lowest earning expectation is $42,500 the first year (hourly plus commissions). This is a job that provided 8 weeks of training before even getting to the actual call center. Many companies don't offer training at all, so this is a great benefit. Also great health benefits, plus 401 K,  options to purchase company stock at a discount. The company emphasis is on improving customer service these days... always a good thing. Also able to earn overtime pay quite easily.","My trainer spent too much time talking about her personal life, and then rushing through the day's training, which was stressful.  Why not cut out all the small talk and go slower during training? Different trainers have different capabilities. some are better than others, so it's the luck of the draw who you get for your 8 weeks of training. There is ultra strict time-keeping... in training we learned the penalties for being even a minute late. Everything needs to be clocked, even going to the restroom. Plus the calls get monitored secretly, so you never know when you're being evaluated. There were hires that seemed to lack education, and their grammar in speaking was not good. This was surprising to me. As a customer, when I call into a call center, when a person can't use the English language appropriately, I'm uncomfortable with their degree of expertise about the product. The training facility rooms need improvement. Broken chairs that squeek LOUDLY every time you move, slow computers, only one screen to learn on when in fact the whole job relies on 2 computer screens. A lot of time is lost going back and forth between programs during training, losing information and time continually, adding to the stress and frustration. One trainer seemed much better than the one I had... I wasn't able to learn well with the trainer I was assigned. The whole training and job itself is very very regimented, so a person will have to learn to be compulsive in that way. I decided not to stay with the company eventually, because my strengths were not used working in a call center on the phone. My experience and past success has to do with person to person inter-action in real life, and so I can understand why the pay and earnings are better than average. It's a job that not everyone wants to do. Being in a call center all day is not for me, but some people obviously like it and do well.",2016-09-27, Customer Account Executive Training (CAE)

5891,2.0,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Great learning experience, in a negative sense.","Benefits are good, income potential good with uncapped bonus potential. Good hours with shift options.","1) training was a night mare. Not because the the knowledge base was not there but the changed where they were going to place us, not once but 3 times in the 2 week training period. Some of the possible options I had no experience in but that didn't seem to matter. In the end it came full circle to the orginal area we interviewed for, all that stress and confession for nothing.
2) transition was unorganized when walked to the floor still not knowing who our supervisor was, no one even knew where we where expected to sit. When finnally sat several times it was decided that it was a mistake. This went in for the entire week. Some of us left behind if the team was moved on their day off, finding no where to sit upon their return. This lead to us spread out randomly throughout the floor, not getting the help or attention needed as a new hire. This continued untill our supervisor was decided and moved to our finnal team.
3) management and employees have a huge disconnect supervisor teach change in service to wow the customer, to better their reputation. Their rating is in the negative below zero rating among customers, they hired an outside company with a multi year plan to change it, spending millions in training, marketing, and branding.  I give them major props for this and there are some success and changes being made. Employees voice is being heard on some levels with positive results.  But supervisors don't hold themselves to what they teach, example- the policy told to employees is if customers asks to speak to your manager to tell customer it will be 24-48 hrs for a return call. You then email the info to your supervisor. It's common knowledge if asked supvisors do not return customers calls. That customer will call in again and justifiedly so  very upset and angry. Even more frustrating is when the agent gets scored by customer in s survey they get marked down for something prior out of their control. In a defense supervisors appear very over worked, always off floor away from their teams in meetings. They have no assistance with time consuming tasks that are not sensitive in nature, other call centers I worked have a team lead to do these tasks and assist with coaching, and driving the team. The supervisors need the tools to manage their time better, and get on board with what they teach to better the company.
4) supervisors are not in touch with how to handle HR issues or proper technical conversation of OSHA privacy. What can and can not be said or asked.  I have experience myself or seen. 

A supervisor  tell an employee that the supervisor had a family member who is a nurse, they said the illness was not serious. Not sure why they needed leave.

I employee returning from leave without a activated badge or system access, the supervisor told employee that those were not his job, proceeded to do nothing to assist.

Seen myself many employees and I myself have experienced problems with Sidwyck, the company who handles many of our leave benefits. They are flat a horrid company making many mistakes, then will deny you for their mistakes. Lost faxes , changed policies midway, short time frames even with their mistakes. It seems they are hired to protect Comcast bottom line, not as a benefit. Comcast to my knowledge has never investigated the claims or even questioned why employee's have so many problem. Supervisors do nothing to assist. Many employees seem to get lost and either quit or get fired on a tectinal issue I believe probably no fault of theirs, either way they are gone.

I was once coached  once just weeks out of training the entire session was spent showing me how much money I cost the supervisor pay check. If I had performed at the same level as the rest of team he would of made $x.xx but I dropped him to $x.xx . Then proceeded to explain how had he could get me fired. To forget HR and time lines. He would write me up everyday  1-2-3 strikes your out, gone in a week. He gave me a month, but in two weeks I was moved to another floor and department. He told me he was doing me a favor.  Sups would talk loud in front of employee how they wish they could trade you for another... Very toxic enviroment at times.",2017-11-22, Anonymous Employee

Unfortunately as a technician they also expect you to do the job of the call centers, the sales staff, the equipment repair department, I.T., accounts recievable (I.E. debt collectors), as well as general bad news delivery. And they expect you to do all of this for just a couple of dollars over minimum wage while telling you they pay way more than the rest of the job market which is a lie. Programs and APPs to do you're day to day job go down daily making incredibly difficult to do your job. Sales staff steal commisions from technicians as well as making promises technicians can't keep that's if they just don't flat out lie to customers. Comcast says technicians are the most important part of the company but every other sales position or call center position has a higher starting wage and the metrics aren't nearly as difficult to make.

Knowing that information talented entry level employee shy away from becoming management and stay in current positions because of job security. They don't really value customers and promote troubled employee just because they have influence over a group of other trouble employee. Lack of available tools to perform work no tools. Over booking jobs to give impression to corporate that they are efficient but Tech are suffering and that in turn causes tech not to be able to provide good customer service. Human Resources seem to be on board with what operation heads i.e Directors want to do whether proper or not.

The communication level of this company is laughable.  I get at least a few calls a week from customers asking about a new product or promotion that they've seen commercials about or received a mailer about that none of us in the call center has even heard of.  The front-line representatives always seem to be the last to know about many things in this company.  Just a day or two ago, a couple of co-workers of mine and I were getting calls about one of the service centers being boarded up... none of us had any idea what was going on or why the store was closed.  A FULL day later, we get a hastily put together e-mail stating that the store was closed for business... then a day after that another email was sent with the date that the store would be reopening.  Really?  What am I supposed to tell my customer?  Make something up so that I can get them off of the phone within the 6 minutes we're allotted for each call before our ""numbers"" are affected?

The expectations and goals set by the higher-ups are ridiculous... and the crazy thing is that they wouldn't be completely ridiculous if we were provided with the correct tools to handle our customers.  But instead, Comcast just drops their front-line employees in a rowboat with no paddles, in the middle of the ocean.  We don't even have estimated time of resolution 98% of the time when an outage occurs.  And what takes the cake... in the past year or so, someone came up with the great idea of adding customer surveys that call the customer back after ending the call.. and these surveys make up part of the scorecard that grades your overall performance.  In theory, this would be a good idea... but when you don't provide your employees with the correct tools to assist your customers, it's a recipe for disaster.  Most of the people choose ratings on the survey based on how upset they are with Comcast.. not because their interaction with the representative was unsatisfactory.  But that doesn't matter... your score is in the toilet because Comcast can't get their act together.

Supervisors don't want to take calls when a customer requests to speak with a supervisor... instead they halfway listen to you explain what the issue is and then tell you what to say to the customer.  WHAT?  You can only imagine the position this puts the representative in... you already have someone on the phone who no longer wants to speak with you, but NOW.. you have the audacity to not honor their simple request... and keep feeding them BS.  And don't DARE get sick without planning it 2 months in advance... every unplanned absence gets a write up.. whether you just didn't feel like coming in or you're in a car crash.

Free tickets to universal studios 

Discounted cable and internet services 

Great benefits","My job was technical support however they wanted me to do transfer of service, billing, retention & sales (which it’s mandatory that you upgrade a customer to another line of business in order to keep your numbers up. If you don’t you will eventually get a write up.) 

Also there is no such thing as support. Supervisors have to do coachings weekly & meeting with manager everyday so they are never available to take a supervisor call. I have had multiple calls where I had to wait an hour just to get assistance. 

They have what they call (itg) which is basically troubleshooting guide that each employee is required to use when customers call in. The guide can be helpful at times but there are many times where it messes up and you have to start over after having the customer on a call. The supervisor doesn’t care that it messed up they make you waste more time by starting over to get a tech appointment.  If you get the opportunity to work from home just no the system is down all the time. If you live in Comcast footprint and your internet goes out due to outage you will have to make that time up even tho it’s their equipment that’s the issue.

They have a support system called real time escalation (rte) they do absolutely nothing! This team is supposed to help you with minor issues (such as where is my tech? Or complaints about employees) they will find a way to not take the call. I have even shown them documents that prove they are supposed to assist with the call and they still say no.",2018-11-19,

5999,3.0,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",Avoid the DCOE,"Well-established company, great benefits, and certainly fair value in terms of pay. Work/life balance is fairly good given a commuter culture in the office. You won't find yourself burning the midnight oil. Great location in the city and it does offer exposure to a lot of moving projects at a time, whether it be business initiatives, tools, etc. Most negatives here only apply to the DCOE, which routinely fell in the bottom of employee satisfaction, but it did seem the rest of the rest of the company was at least content enough.","The DCOE is generally a challenge. Leadership can seem detached from the necessary day-to-day in terms of end results on a couple of fronts. First, you have a disconnect of resources and focus - a lot of resources all seemingly running in different directions rather than being a little more aligned. It's a typical symptom of larger companies, but always felt to be a little more disorganized within the DCOE than elsewhere. The second piece is that translates to brute forcing projects. While work life balance is definitely strong, that doesn't mean within work hours things can't routinely get stressful when ""war rooms"" are called on a frequent basis to chase something. Comcast, as an employer, has the scale to be inefficient like this, but more organized organizations would have a better way to be ahead of things rather than most random things turn into a fire. All of this leads to minimal direction on an employee level as far as growth. You can be at Comcast and have a career for a long time, but understand most promotions/growth will be out of attrition, not out of earned performance.",2019-02-15, Senior Manager

This is customer service, not sales.  This is how Comcast got to be so big.  You can meet all product goals in a month and get written up.  You need to make a “sale” on every call (its impossible).  People call in and hang up, call from the wrong market, unauthorized people call in to ask misc questions, your own collection, billing and repair reps call you to ask questions, people that are having a missed install date and time, people that just want to talk to a live person that have a billing or repair issue call you… all of these calls count against you and if you work later in the day (after 7:00pm) they become the majority of the calls.

If you don’t make close rate or revenue for a month, but you destroy the production numbers (phone Tv (D1) and internet) then you still get written up and threaten to be fired.  This means they are going to get rid of you in 2 months.  The company has to go through all checks and balances to show that they give everyone an opportunity.  

I understand this concept, its something we learned about at college.  You don’t want to pay full time employees, so you add in metrics that don’t mean anything so you can turn them.

I was encouraged by two supervisors to stay off the phone as much as possible after 7:00 pm because it hurt my close rate.  Or to stay on an individual call as long as possible.  This tells me that they know the system is flawed.

Your role is not to manage accounts that's why they are there except you find yourself 3 to 4 hours out of day trying to figure out why account is rejected and nobody knows why.  
Communication is terrible - Residential doesn't communicate with Business and visa versa - so a business owner who typically is a home owner with our services you would have no clue until you walked in door.
Systems - 4 Systems to learn just to find out who has service and if it is possible to be serviced.
Systems - The systems actually work against you, no streamlined process for submitting documentation.  
Systems- You are selling against your own system, if there is a company error it states in sales hand book company will not recourse the error ""it is what it is"".
Selling - Lots of fun, you create freedom but only competition is your team: BSRS, DSRS, EAE's, BAE 2, BAE 3 and even BAE 1's you have no locked territory and after 14 days of selling if no communication the inside sales team can work your opportunities.  Catch is you cannot work theirs.
Communication again is terrible, you spend allot of time in account management and only 12 to 17% of the 5,000 + sales people are hitting goal.  The company has a point structure, revenue structure and goal structure so if you sell a product but not the right product it can work against you financially.

Many times, time off requests can be denied or you get put on waiting list.  Its amazing how often comcast outages occur on the network every day, very fragile system it seems. They put business customers services over  a very old residential infrastructure and the business network should have its own network instead of trying to buyout other companies they should pour the money into the network build out and make these outages go away.

I found that for a leading technology firm, our reporting system was outdated and didn't accurately reflect the sales we were capturing sometimes inflating them and other times understating them--which left our meetings ominous for detecting which sales approaches were effective and those which were not.  Because the company is so large, it takes quite some time to get permission to make changes to a customary way of doing things even though the system is broken and doesn't serve the business in the long run.  Though not always the case in other departments, I felt a very strong sense of micro-management--not my personal preference, but not to be taken personally as my directive preferred a hands-on approach and likes to know all aspects of the business.

 Comcast's products and services are often on bleeding edge and employees cannot help but be excited to sell or support them. 
Depending on regional leadership, Comcast fosters a super culture of collaboration. Washington state business services used to be this way.","Business Services Washington may have too many sales people considering how mature the market is. Comcast has a tendency to hire more people to get more sales, but this creates high employee churn.  There are also numerous and significant operational obstacles that make it hard to focus on sales.
The Seattle business services market has been at the very bottom of company performance ranking for 2.5 years.  Numerous possible explanations exist for this but it may stem from the type of culture that has existed under the VP and his immediate team. 
The Washington state business services market leader has created a fairly fearful and exclusive culture. There are lots of politics.  The VP has surrounded himself with ""yes"" people that he worked with from past jobs - most of whom are not particularly competent or stay employed places very long. None of these people appointed or hired by the VP have ever been fired despite the Seattle region being one of he worst regions in the company. Instead, anyone who isn't perceived as being part of the C.Y.A. Culture (usually tenured people hired by other leaders) are scapegoated and pushed out.  HR and corporate leaders are either clueless or powerless to do anything about this.

It's definitely based off of who's butt you kiss, and who you can warm up to the best. Typical office gossip, and office politics. Call Centers are always based off of Metrics & some of those metrics are unreasonable. Their call flow model is called S4. And it's scored by a 3rd party company that you CANNOT challenge unless it's obvious. And even at that point it's your supervisors decision. Each call can be challenged by your supervisor but some just don't. Bc they don't want to. I personally had a supervisor that did it on EVERY SINGLE CALL. And at the end of the day, I performed best on his team. Their attendance point system is the worst ever. You can be in trouble for missing work due to the WEATHER. Your supervisor can also fight for you. But that's like a hit and miss bc they have to ""want to fight for you"". I've seen people (yes, plural) get fired over scenarios like that.

6204,2.0,"Current Employee, more than 5 years",5 reasons to and 8 reasons not to work at Comcast,"1. Great health, dental, vision packages

2. 401K, stock options

3. Heavily discounted cable services (phone, TV, internet, home security)

4. Decent starting/base pay with quarterly bonuses

5. Nearly impossible to get fired","I stay because of the ""pros"" and that's true for most employees. Comcast knows that too.

1. Annual ""reorganizations"" cause stress and anxiety among employees because you ""might be next"".

2. Nearly impossible to move up in terms of pay, position, or gaining new experience or skill set (online training are a poor substitute).

3. Workplace culture varies widely. Some places have it good, others not so good, and a few horribly.

4. Changes outside the annual ""reorganization"" occur faster and more often than a chameleon in a paint factory. What you do or know today, won't be the same by the weekend.

5. Metrics and meetings are in about as much quantity as change is. Gets nauseating.

6. Clueless/useless ""leadership"" who have no idea what they should be doing or what their employees should be or are doing.

7. Recognition can be non-existent or overly gratuitous to the point it's insulting.

8. Come review time, expect a lot of mental masturbation but an embarrassingly low increase in pay. Everyone is to get about the same raise regardless if your metrics are about as bright as a black hole or shining like gold.  Performance is not and never will be tied to raises.",2016-05-20,

TV & Internet are essentially free, just pay for the equipment.","So many things out of your control. Number of calls you can take are restricted even though you get a ton of pollution on your phone, i.e. non sales calls. You literally only take the order. Someone else builds the account and the services on the account. Someone else determines if it's serviceable or not. Another person does the install. So many people can affect the order. Someone else leaving off a service or selecting the wrong service, or not scheduling a port of phone numbers, or turning off the customers services early, or the tech not showing for an installation or even going to the install without a modem or cable tv box. It's not hard to get someone to sign up for service...it's just hard to get them service. So many customers call in that we can't provide service to and we will know it in the first minute of the call, yet we are still expected to spend 10+ minutes or so going through our consultative sales flow sheet, uncovering their needs and still getting them to sign, getting their hopes up, sending the order for a site survey which can take up to 7 business days to get a result on and then telling them, sorry, we're not able to provide you with service. This is the first company i've worked for where you don't get a pay raise after a year. Their quota relief for time off is a joke. You're allowed to submit for only half the time you can take off for quota relief.

Please ask for a ride day and ask the rep how many clients do not already have Comcast.

They do pay mileage at federal rate but cap it at $100 per week....you will go through this in 1-2 days...the additional amount is ""cost of doing business"" and will come out of your pocket.

Comp plan is decent. There are accelerators for the few that can hit them but also very steep detracters if you fall short of goal. (More reps miss there number than make it)

You always know where you stand among your colleagues.  Everyday a report is sent out to all sales employees in the region that shows everyone else's sales numbers month to date so you know how you stack up.  Great if you are doing well, but demoralizing if you are not.","Think of all the perks that come with most sales jobs...freedom, flexible schedule, working remotely, etc.  This has NONE of that!!!

Regarding my brief 3 month experience on the Central Connecticut Team in WNE (Berlin, CT).  Here, you will be required to check into the office everyday at 8AM but be out of the office before 9:30am to get in your car to drive back from where you came from (most salespeople live in the territory they cover). You will then go knock doors prospecting for business. At 3:00pm you are required to be back in the Berlin office to make phone calls till 5PM or submit orders, while the manager walks around to make sure people are making calls.

At 5PM, there is a mandatory team conference call that will last between 30-45 minutes where you will explain what you did that day, how many sales you got, new opportunities found, number of appointments you sat on that day, number of appointments the following day, and your forecast for tomorrow. If you make a sale and it happened to contain voice and data, but the client did not want TV, you will need to explain why you they did not get TV and vice versa.  If you sold a lower tier Internet speed, you will have to explain why it was not a 50Mbps or faster connection.  In some instances the manager will insist going back to the client together and try to convince the client to get all 3 services or to increase their speed, because you as the sales professional, clearly did not listen to their needs the first time.

If you leave before the call is over you will be labeled a ""non team player"", so hopefully you dont mind traffic. My commute was dificult, but not nearly as bad as the guy who lived in the springfield Massachusetts area (yes he had to be in the office twice everyday too...no exceptions)

Tuesdays and Thursdays you will have in person  huddles where they will teach you things such as top down selling, wedge statements, open ended questions, or practice role plays (great information if you have never had a sales job before).  After the huddle you will have a 1 on 1 with your manager or a ride day where he shadows you and tells you what you did right or wrong in a condescending tone.  In the event that you miss a team huddle for being sick or more than 5 minutes late, you will have to make it up later that week with the manager.

On any given day, there can be no more than 2 people off due to ""business needs"", this includes holidays such as day before thanksgiving, black friday, Christmas eve, day after christmas, new years eve and new years day among others.

I worked there for 3 months and went through velocity training and finished my ramp period.  At the end of that time, my manager held a formal review and said that ""unfortunately it was not going to work out and that I did not have the attitude needed to be successful here"", so i was let go.  Part of me felt bad being rejected and all, but I was also happy knowing that I would not have to endure this horrible and demeaning sales culture any longer.

Had I known before hand what this job was all about, I never would have accepted it.  I have had several sales jobs over my career, recently coming over from the online advertising industry and have never been treated like this before.  Hope someone finds this information useful before making the same mistake I made.",2015-12-02, Business Account Executive

8181,1.0,"Former Employee, less than 1 year",No one knows what they are doing,"When I interviewed with the district manager everything seemed great!   The company is trying to improve their customer service through hiring retail managers.  They are controlling the cost of programming and padding the savings on to the customer.  They want the customer experience in the stores to be more positive even though most customers only go to stores if they have a problem.  Trying to move from a ""dmv"" atmosphere to a warmer and more welcoming one.","In the panel interview (2 district managers and 1 hr representative) it very quickly became apparent that they have no idea how to implement the changes they want.  It's as if the only idea they could think of was to hire retail managers with experience in customer service.  Still, there is no support for the managers to enforce the changes.  This policy of being more ""customer friendly"" is about a year old.  Yet no changes gave been made.  Associates are still evaluated on the number of sign ups they get and not how friendly they are.  One of the DMs actually told me ""reviews are coming up next month and a lot of people are going to be surprised and disappointed.""  When I asked how a year could go by without any feedback regarding performance all three of them looked at me with blank expressions.  What good could ever come from working for a company that has certain expectations but doesn't communicate your performance (or lack thereof) until your review?

Others are still stuck in high school and will never grow up.,"Leadership is horrible.  Don't get me wrong.  A few of the local supervisors are really good.  Other have been promoted beyond their capabilities.  Comcast touts a mantra of ""One Comcast"" that couldn't be farther from the truth. Every work group within Comcast has its own set of goals and metrics and none of them are pointing in the same direction.  What's worse is this is the worst communicating company I've ever worked for bar none.  So with this combination Comcast across the board spends a disproportionate amount of time and resources misfiring causing customer aggravation, constant employee churn, and they unnecessarily burn through resources and customers like they have them to spare. 

As an employee it's ungodly frustrating to work for a company that has no interest in providing you (the employee) the tools and resources you need on a daily basis to create a positive experience for your internal and external customers.  I have to literally fight my employer (Comcast) DAILY to get what I need to service their customers.  Training is entirely inadequate for company employees.  This is the reason when you call Comcast it depends on who you get as to what kind of service quality you receive.  It's basically up to the person to train themselves, or don't.  Comcast doesn't care and they won't fire anyone for poor performance (no accountability).  That … and the fact that there are more contract workers here than there are actual company employees and the contract workers have zero accountability. 

The further up the leadership chain you go, the more disconnected they are from what's going on at your level.  The problem is this is where all the decisions are made and handed down to your level.  As such, the decisions that are handed down by the corporate overlords make little sense to the day-to-day operations on the ground and are further complicated by the lack of communication of their decisions to all applicable parties.",2014-11-06," Comm Ops II, Dispatch"

- There are customers that will flat out refuse to add video service and will refuse your sales pitch no matter how much you explain about the benefits, tie it to their needs, explain the features, etc but Comcast will keep pushing you to make people get video to meet the 75% minimum video attachment rate if you want to pass your scorecard and not get written up or fired. 

- Supervisors and Managers will constantly be pushing you to sell triple play packages and quad play packages to customers who may only want 1-2 services.   

- Not all the calls you receive are sales calls, only about 10% of the calls you receive are actual sales calls and the rest are people who dialed the wrong extention or just dialed any extension in the automated system to get to a live person when they were trying to reach a department like billing, tech support, or the disconnections department but here they are speaking to the sales department and each call you receive that you dont sell anything lowers your attachment rate (even if its not a sales call) so good luck making that 40% general attachment rate to pass scorecard.

- Alot of people will call in just to ask for information about promotions or prices but have no intention of buying anything on the call and if you try to close the sale with them they will say things like ""I have to talk to my spouse before making a decision"", you offer to call their spouse and they will say that their not available, you offer to call them back at a later time and they wont pick up their phone at the time they agreed for you to call them back 99% of the time.

- On top of the attachment rate goals there are also other metrics you have to meet to pass scorecard like revenue per call, total revenue sold, amount of security systems sold (need 2 minimum monthly to pass), Quality Analysts score (how good you follow a script), and their talking about adding more things to the scorecard as well.

- If your not meeting your sales goals you will be constantly harassed every day you come into work by your supervisor and their manager asking what your doing to improve your numbers, trying to get you to compete against other agents, hinting that if you dont improve your sales you may be written up, put on a performance improvement plan that prevents you from switching to another department that might be a better fit for you, and letting you know every day that being on a performance improvement plan is 1 step away from getting fired, etc.

- The Comcast commercials are deceptive because they advertise that you can get $19.99 internet but its really $24.99 and you receive a $5 discount if you sign up for automatic payments and bills via email if not you pay $24.99 and Comcast advertises that it ""comes with 5 lines of mobile already included"" but each mobile line is $45 a month for unlimited data or $12 per each GB of data (which is said in the small letters in the commercial that people dont read).

- You have to constantly follow up on your orders to make sure nobody cancelled your sales order and re-entered it with their sales id because you only have 3 days to dispute it after the installation completes if not the person who stole your sale gets the credit for it.

- 90 day chargebacks on your sales if the customer disconnects for any reason even if their moving to a new location within 90 days or if they installed in one address and then changed their apartment number or address within 90 days.

- Sales department works all holidays

- The script you have to follow is constantly changing and the Quality Analysts deduct points for petty things and knit pick your calls so that nobody has a perfect score.

- The company is always changing and restructuring, I used to work in National Bilingual Retention for several years and then one day all of a sudden the company director comes in and tells everyone in the call center to go to a room for a meeting to make an announcement and they tell us that Spanish Retention is getting outsourced to Mexico, English Retention is going to be based out of Jacksonville,  FL and the Philippines, and that our call center is getting converted to Regional Spanish only Sales which I thought wasnt so bad at first because I wouldnt have to deal with irate customers anymore from Bilingual Retention until I actually started working in Spanish only Sales and saw all the unrealistic sales goals they have to pass the scorecard and all the things agents have to deal with to make the company happy.

- Commission isnt what it used to be, I used to make better money working in National Bilingual Retention than I do now working as a Regional Spanish only Sales agent. 

- Lack of positions to move to, I tried seeing if maybe there was another department that I could transfer to since im not happy in Spanish only sales but the company barely posts job openings for internal employees that want to switch departments, they would rather hire new people from outside to fill positions. 

- Comcast used to raffle out big prizes for selling like 50+ inch LED TV's, Xbox, Playstation, ipads, etc but that all stopped once our center became Spanish only Sales.",2018-05-12, Inbound Sales

8530,1.0,"Former Employee, more than 5 years",A former shell of what was a great company to work for.,"Free cable, set hours for hourly staff (though you have to be there for years to get high enough on the tenure list for decent hours).","I began in 2003 and when the recession hit five years later, every employee was expected to do three times the work for the same amount of pay.  In the call center there was a clear and achievable path to move up levels and get very good raises.  That became non-existant as the goals become unattainable. 

Retaliatory actions by supervisory and management staff to subordinates is just horrific.  If a supervisor or management staff member doesn't like you for whatever reason, there is a good chance they will do whatever they can to fire you or at the very least, make your life a living hell.  

They hire people with no business serving customers which is why their support can be so awful for customers. 

Every singe phone rep is now required to sell and troubleshoot every service even though most were only brought in and trained to do one.

Dispatch is a nightmare and the good field techs are far outweighed by contractors who do a piss-poor job most of the time.

Hours are horrible to start and even as you go up in tenure, they still have crap schedules for all but the most seasoned of front line employees. 

Entire departments are let go without any warning or notice.

They will fight every single unemployment claim no matter what the reason of job loss.

They have replaced every HR rep that cared about the employees with ones that work to protect the company.

A monopoly in so many areas. 

I loved this job when I began in 2003 and in the first few years it was a great place to work.  The community was strong and management cared about their staff.  Once they required all supervisors and management to put in 60 hour work weeks minimum (once you go salary you become their slave) that all changed.  Every supervisor who actually cared about their team and questioned the horrible decisions made by upper management were either fired or their jobs become a living hell due to the aforementioned retaliatory actions.  The supervisors and managers who promote are all ""Yes-Men"" who are corporate puppets for the Roberts family (and high up exec) billionaires that care nothing about their employees or customers.",2013-01-11, Customer Service Representative
8531,1.0,"Current Employee, more than 10 years",Never again,"When i first started with Comcast they bought out the local Adelphia cable system, everything seemded fine, until recently.","About around 2009 things started to change dramatically. Customer assistance fell by the wayside when we would no longer support half the equipment that we provided subscribers (ie routers, gateway systems and phone products). The same time the training for the job was getting less and less for any new products, it would get so bad that you would be asked by the customer how a certain new product worked and it would be something that you hadn't even heard about. When training was offered it was months after the fact, and rushed also to get a whole days training into a 45 min session. Last year my former tech support department was dissolved locally and moved to a different city so I was offered to reskill to stay local or commute. I reskilled, the reskill training was no better, anyone coming from tech department to the retention department previously would go throught a 6 week training program going over all types of things, we were given a week training and most of the time it was making posters and different signs not doing any real sales training or anything really pertinent to the job. After this for about 2 months I was sat with a supervisor that did nothing to help me to transition to this new position that I feel was forced on me. All around me people who know their job are being replaced by people who do not, and are giving out false and incorrect information.  Now I am being told that the new people off the street are getting the sales training that was denied to me and others. Wouldn't it make sence to invest in your long time employees since they know the products like the back of thier hand. My voice of the customer rating is constistently at or around 100% and that means absolutely nothing now since now matter how happy they are with me if I dont sell them something else on top of what they have then I get knocked down regardless. If someone calls in now to lower ther bill and you are able to keep the services they have and RETAIN them as a customer it still means nothing since you didn't up their bill with another service that they don't want. Most people who get on my phone called a few days before and were charged something that they don't need or want to get a rep's commision higher and then I have to remove it to keep a customer or they will cancel. So at that point my stats go down lower so I can maintain my own ethical morals to help someone. I am currently looking for another place of employment so that I am not forced to undermine my own credibility by continually lying to the customer about not being able to help them save moeny when I see a lower price but giving this to them means cutting my nose off. To top it off with my seniority at the company my pay rate was cut down from around 18$ to 12$ so that I could stay local in a new department and seniority here means next to nothing anymore since restructuring the more sales you push the more say you have, leaving me and others like me just wallowing in the shadows.",2013-04-05, CAE

*Good benefits","*Pay is a joke - The base pay is around $15-16. I was told by a recruiter that based on my education, my base pay would be a bit higher. A whopping 75 cents higher.  Considering all the call center reps deal with, the long hours and the pathetic attendance policy, you’d think they would at least pay their employees a minimum of $18/hr to start. They’re a well known company, I think you can afford to pay your employees better than that. They try to sucker you in with the idea of “monthly incentives” and “sales goals” to help raise your pay, but it’s the most minuscule amount they could possibly give you. Also, you receive an annual bonus. But don’t expect to see that bonus if you have 1 unexcused absence. 

*Attendance policy is unrealistic - if you miss 10 minutes-50% of your shift you receive .5 UAP (unexcused absence). If you miss 51%-100% of your shift you receive 1 UAP. 3 UAPs total and you are fired (if you don’t have any vacation/flex/float time). It’s unrealistic to hold employees to this standard. Life happens, and this company needs to be aware of that.

*Hours are ridiculous - You can either work 5 8 hours shifts or 4 10 hour shift. Saturdays are mandatory no matter what you choose. A call center should be open during regular business hours. There’s no need to be open past 5:00 pm, let alone on a Saturday. 

*Training is extensive and over the top - They put you through 6 weeks of training that consists of videos, readings, quizzes and practicing calls. Which doesn’t help you retain any information at all. It’s basically like you’re in school for 8 hours a day. They throw all of this information at you and expect you to remember every last detail about all of their services. Then have the nerve to tell you, “don’t get used to it because these will probably change in 6 months.”

*Leaders give you the run around when it comes to asking for help - Asked a trainer a question regarding benefits information, she told me to reach out to a supervisor. So, I asked two of the supervisors (via email) for help. Both ignored me. Tried again with supervisor A and she told me to ask a peer to help me. You are a supervisor, YOU are the one who is supposed to help me. I reached out to supervisor B, and she finally assisted me.

The center in Pittsburgh is becoming what's called a ""Platinum"" call center.  Comcast claims this will be used to make the customer experience better.

8617,1.0,"Current Employee, less than 1 year",Door to Door Sales Review,"Big company, lots of collateral and training resources. Pay rate is good. Benefits are good.","Statistically, this company, along with Time Warner, is the most hated company in America based on the University of Michigan's ""American Customer Satisfaction Index"". I'm not at all surprised. I was so embarrassed by the company's consistently ill treatment of it's customers, that I left after just a few short months. 

Comcast's callous disregard is not reserved only for the welfare of it's customers, but extends to the sales force as well. New employees at my location were given impossible territories while veterans were allowed to cherry pick and use banned selling tactics. Shady business practices are overlooked by management as long as results are achieved, all the while being constantly reminded via memos and meetings that such practices are not allowed. This is done so that any time one of these shady deals goes wrong, the sales person can be thrown under the bus and management can claim they didn't know what was happening.  

Customer service is absolutely embarrassing. You're told to promise customers the moon to get them to sign a contract and tell them they can call you if they have any problems. When they do inevitably have problems, the company won't help the customer. The customer calls you for help. As their sales person, you call the customer service on their behalf to find that they won't help you either! You're usually referred back to your manager who is busy selling himself, and has no interest at all in helping your customer. Worse than that, my manager would say it was taken care of - which I would pass on to the customer, and then nothing would change. 

The net effect is that you look like a big liar. You tell your customer you're taking care of their issues, and then it doesn't happen even though you've gone through all the proper channels --- over, and over and over. While you're wrestling with that mess and trying to keep from having all your sales cancelled, you're expected to be out selling new contracts all day. Eventually, you look at a new sale as a morass of new problems waiting to happen. It's extremely demotivating.",2014-08-26, Field Sales

Veteran friendly","- Does not honor promise of location close to home even when it is possible. Makes it difficult to change this situation even when it is obviously burdensome to employees.

- Acts like they are promoting a fair and friendly workplace during the hiring process, but treats you like you are a grunt in the army after they hire you. There is no real management structure and anyone with a position can tell you what to do with little or no repercussions. The bad part of them hiring veterans is Comcasts encourages them to continue like they are in the military, treating employees as if they should have no life whatsoever, except what they are told to do.

- Deceiving promotion of ""life to work balance"" and available overtime. What they don't tell you is you will be forced to do overtime whenever they feel like it. That overtime is not by CHOICE, it is by force - and therefore is not a ""benefit"", but they promote it as if it is.

- Pay is cheap, especially for the work that is required of you, and the pay raises are minuscule at best. They call you a tech, but pay you peanuts and want you to thank them for it.

- They promote employee fairness on one hand, but on the other treat certain classes like they aren't included. CommTechs, for example are routinely scapegoated, slammed with too many assignments, treated and disrespected by managers as their leisure. Nobody listens to them even though they are the people on the scene and their work process is constantly being overstuffed with anyone's ""ideas"", detrimental or not without any form of compensation or time relief. For the lower classes of workers there is no employee empowerment, despite Comcast edicts that constantly speak of it as if there is. Employees are weak and abuse is rampant.

-Management is not required to know the skills of the people they are managing, creating a ""personality"" atmosphere where an employee gets by by learning how to appease an incompetent boss. There is also a lot of abuse and upper management doesn't seem to be concerned.

-Insane work pace (which includes an undisclosed requirement to spend hours after your ""official"" work time). A system where those who are assigning jobs can abuse the ones who are working them - for example sending you to a job 60 miles away from the last one; or sending you to a job that will take 4-5 hours at the last hour of your shift (and Comcast forces you to do it, although they could either send someone else or find a solution that wouldn't negatively impact employees). They send Techs to two jobs per hour, and if you finish them they expect you to ask for more - like a monkey on a string. Note that just activating a new modem or box can take 20 minutes or more! You can cancel a job - but Comcast punishes you by de-marking you in their abusive metric system, that punishes people more the lower their job title is in the company.

-Metric system - yes, their metric system is nothing more than a punishment device. What happens is you are given an impossible task, and if you cannot complete it a certain way you get negative points, which can negatively affect your measly salary. (Note that AT&T pays almost twice as much for the same position - despite having their own issues). Your process is constantly getting ""updated"", added to and delays to your strategy are added, with no adjustment to this system whatsoever. They act as though adding an hour extra to your hourly workload has no impact... which leads us to:

- Employees cutting corners. Employees do not follow safety regulations. Not at all. Not even a little bit. The company doesn't actually help them either, unless you call Supervisors who know nothing showing up and yelling at you because your little cone isn't out ""helping""... Your equipment broke? Wait... wait... wait some more. Maybe there is a used belt somewhere they can find for you. Employees are supposed to be trained in safety and several disciplines - but their training is not taken seriously. They rush people through it and throw them in the field. They do not help the employee get experience but ASSUME they do. They set you up with a regular employee for a few weeks and ASSUME they are teaching you - but those workers are either not interested, under-skilled or could care less about you learning anything. The other assumption is that since these people are out in the field (slave terminology?) that they will run into all of the jobs they need to learn what they are required to learn - WRONG AGAIN. The training is handled like a lottery, betting on trainees getting every type of job they need to learn - but in actuality since there is no program when a trainee is in the field, you just become some Tech's side-kick, and there is no guarantee your needed assignment will ever come up. Guess who gets the blame for that? THE TRAINEE. You should have ""asked"" your trainer to teach you something that you have no idea that you should have know... its your fault, because you know - you helped put the training program together...So after the training phase is over your out in the field trying to figure it out by yourself, which is why so many Techs are breaking every OSHA regulation and risking their lives every day. When these employees are called out, it becomes ""Their fault"", management takes no responsibility for creating an abusive working atmosphere that breeds this kind of response. Over half of the jobs are repeats, but management doesn't seem to learn that crushing people in an unreasonable work pace, under threat of discipline is not efficient. It makes people rush through a job and make it ""look"" like it is done - just for the metrics. he fact is, when a tech knows that their shift is about over, they try like hell to not get stuck with one of those forced overtime situations - and who can blame them?

- Wasted resources in a worker resource that nobody cares about, and has possible leaks. They tell you about this way to improve the company - go to comcastnow.com and submit an ""anonymous"" report. Next thing you know your getting some kind of punishment. It would be nice if they took it seriously , but employees are mostly afraid to say anything because they do not trust it.

- Forced waiting periods in the promotion or lateral movement. They act like your locked in after you get hired. No matter how talented you are they tell you to wait for a year (or 6 months, or 3 months depending on who you ask) before you can move to another position. Say you want to work in Comcast Business - if you didn't get directly hired in that position in the first place you will have to wait a year - for no reason whatsoever. They will say they want you to have ""experience"" in another position - but if that's the case why does someone else walk off the street and get that position? Also, Supervisors can stop you from being promoted with little or no reason - like whether they like you personally or not.

- Management has the attitude that people who haven't been promoted must not want to. It isn't like they ask people, they just assume that is the case and just leave people to burn. They even say this fondly as if those people are happy scratching out cheap pay and getting blamed for all Comcast's problems. The also act like new hires are getting some kind of welfare, as if they should all kiss Comcast's backside because Comcast is doing all this for them. Forget about qualifying with a resume, experience and evaluations - you just rolled up off the street and Comcast ""gave you"" this welfare benefit.",2017-09-19, Comm Tech

Mention the words ""Customer Guarantee"" to an employee and receive free HBO/Showtime/Skinimax/Starz free for 3 months.","Disconnected departments, old technology, poorly educated frontline operators and shrinking budgets. Comcast is outsourcing a lot of work outside of the United States, and at the same time changing from local operations to huge regional call centers referred to as ""Centers of Excellence.""

Comcast's StreamPix is a laughable attempt to compete with Netflix. Comcast also blocks HBOGo from playing through directly to Roku or Apple TV ""because they want to control the customer's experience"" (aka: pay $10/mth for a Comcast cable box)

Headquarters - Interesting direct observation ""tribal warfare"" between the various factions of socio-political ""teams"" trying to prove that the inflated salaries they are being paid are worth the money.

Every years employee benefits become less & less. Comcast Cable is doing all it can to turn over as much cash as possible, as to pay for the disaster called ""the NBC Universal merger."" What a waste of money led by a couple of egos in an ivory tower.",2013-09-09, Public & Employee Relations

Great group of repair agents to work with.","Keep in mind that 90% of the call center agents want to help the customer, but Comcast has it set up for their employees to fail at this goal.  The agents I worked with really cared about getting customers' equipment/services working, but Comcast corporate does not share that same outlook.  Comcast pushes their repair agents to sell, sell, sell, and that is where the other 10% comes in - to meet the unrealistic metrics of their repair center, some agents feel the pressure to add services to customer's accounts without their knowledge.  Comcast does nothing about this - just as long as you are selling.   You are given very little repair training in their 6-week training course, which is a joke.  During training, Comcast brings in Supervisors from the floor to talk about their great Comcast experiences.  They come in all smiles, helpful, friendly - but when you get on the floor - no more smiles or helpfulness. You are informed in training that if you EVER need to go to the bathroom go - but once on the floor - you get an IM from several Supervisors asking you to take your bathroom breaks on your own time.  Which if you start work at 1pm and your first break isn't until 3:45pm makes it a bit difficult to hold.  You get consistently scolded for going to the bathroom or helping out another agent because ""Aux"" time is way more important (FCC rules - so they say) than your well being or helping a co-worker. There is no consistency on the floor.  Some agents get by with sleeping at their desks and then others like me, just wanting to go to bathroom - gets a written warning.  Also, they give you 10 minutes to start your computer and all of the necessary programs to do your job. This takes a full 10 minutes. Then Comcast does not give you the opt. to review emails, service updates, trending logs, important information to do your job effectively.   Instead, they demand you do this on ""YOUR OWN TIME"", so basically you are working overtime, without the pay - the last I remember, this was ""illegal"".  I brought this to the attention of the director & vp of Comcast - was told to ""read quickly"".   Once I informed Comcast of this, is when I began receiving IMs from Supervisors about going to the bathroom. They pushed me out the door with their harassment. The frequency I go to the bathroom is just like anybody else.    Some agents come in as much as 30 minutes before their shift starts to read all the updates, etc.",2013-10-17, 3P CAE REPAIR

All Comcast cares about is money and if you have an issue, don't bother bringing it up because supervisors and management are trained to only talk positive about something that is not. Metrics are placed to make it impossible to get promoted. They say they care about military, they do not. I've been talked down on every time I get called out on orders. When I am gone, my numbers still count against me. It's impossible for someone in the military to get a raise when they are not here making the already impossible productivity to rework metrics. Overtime is forced on employees. Supervisors do not care nor help when really needed. Pay is awful for the type of work we do. I've been here for 3 years and still make the same as when I started. Customers yell at us even though it's not our fault the company lies to them, climb up sketchy poles and have to work in some of the most filthy cockroach infested houses for a merely 15 an hour. Insurance is expensive so it's like you get paid minimum wage, and the vehicles given to us are falling apart, but because Comcast only cares about saving money, deal with it. They get on your about productivity, but it's impossible when you have to sit and wait for a modem to boot up for 30 minutes or longer, then you have to wait for a pht test another 40 minutes for hopefully the devices to pass. If something doesn't pass, you're there even longer to figure out why and getting a phone call from the supervisor asking what's taking so long. You can't make your next job, too bad, they have no other tech to give it to and your getting a late which also affects your numbers. Oh and after every job, the customer gets a call to take a survey about how you did it how they feel about the company... They hit the wrong number or you don't get perfect 5's or 10's, don't even think about getting promoted for the rest of the year. This company is a joke and like I said, all they care about is money. They make you take a survey every month and scare you into giving great scores because it affects the supervisors, and if anyone does say anything negative, they don't bring it up. Not to mention that equipment never works.

Harsh 90 day no-tolerance policy for lateness, or even planned-in-advance absence.

Junior management took special pleasure in writing me up for being under three minutes late.

Poor Training:
It's clear the training program assumes high turnover, and so rushes to get value out of you.
Training is the equivalent of having your skull opened and a jumble of information dropped onto it. Then stirred. It's too much at once.
There is no use-what-you-learned live training, so you learn about three or four weeks of material then get dropped into taking live calls. They do not give you a limited area first to master, though this would be trivial with their ACD phone system. Cable TV troubleshooting is the easiest, but they don't let you do just that for a few days.

General:
Most of the support issues are around billing. Even the ""new and improved"" billing is every bit as convoluted as it has been. Multiply that by multiple billing systems for different regions.
Their phone service is not mature. Most of the fixes involve power cycling the phone ""modem"".
It's an open secret that they must staff to certain levels to keep the FCC happy.

Things just keep getting worse. More clueless directors, middle and upper management. No wonder customers hate Comcast. Everything has become so disjointed, and inconsistent. There has been WAY too much outsourcing. The company has outsourced so many job functions, that it has lost direction. Departments are often working at cross-purposes. 
Pay is WELL below industry peers. All management knows how to do is micro-manage and change direction. Every new VP or upper management member that comes in drastically changes our direction and organization, just so they can look like they're trying to improve things. All this does is disrupt employees' lives by either a layoff or quintupling commutes! All for no real benefit. The micro-managing is done by middle and upper management trying to control things they have never done or have any idea about whatsoever. Different departments are at odds with each other.
Management will not even consider letting employees, whose whole jobs are on the PC, work from home. I believe this is more of their micro-management. Pay is different for employees doing the exact same job. Those of us who are motivated and work hard are given more work, while those who slack are left alone to slack off some more, even spending their day on IM with their love interest. . Upper management has enacted pay caps, basically eliminating employee motivation. I'm sure management hasn't capped their pay, have they? Great behavior for a multi-billion dollar company.

So much of customer service has been outsourced, both in and out of country, that the customer frustration factor has increased exponentially. Management needs to realize that you get what you pay for.
Since removing motivation for long-term employees, it seems the drive is to try to get rid of those of us who have been here long-term in favor of new employees they can pay less.
Also, HR is completely useless; merely a mouthpiece for upper management. Their employee retention policy is to tell us ""be happy you have a job."" WOW, there's a motivator.....to look elsewhere.
Upper management is so disconnected from reality. They really have no idea what is going on beyond our stock price. You let the bean counters make WAY too many of the decisions.
Employee morale is is so low, as to be nonexistent. We all hate our jobs. The only thing keeping us coming in is our paycheck. This used to be a career for me, but since 2010, its just a paycheck. Employee morale is so low because we all know things will NEVER get better. Management needs to realize that their smoke and mirrors attempts (Credo-speak survey, Credo-Pulse survey) to give the impression that they are trying to improve things don't fool us.

-If I could have reviewed my experience at Comcast during my first full year, I would have rated it as one of the best jobs that anyone could ever have!  To find the truth, please review the cons.

-During my first year, it was work at your own pace and sell to anyone and everyone.  The job was everything you would want it to be just as long as you made your numbers/sales and were in compliance with company policies.

-Employees received high recognition for their accomplishments.

-Base salary plus commission, All company products were discounted to the employee, gas allowance, new uniforms and supplies provided, bonuses for high producers w/ the possibility to achieve a 6 figure income.","-Everything that was a PRO usually changed on an often basis because management was ever always shifting around after my first year.

-Within the two years that I worked for Comcast, 7 direct and senior managers were either replaced, fired, or asked to resign.  The shift in management is still ongoing from my understanding.  

-Always constant change with how the sales reps were able to make sales. One minute you might be paid for a sale, the next day, it might be taken away from the rep due to the area that it was sold in.  The next week, the rep may be able to sell in that same area again with no penalties.

-Comcast is in competition with itself.  As a sales rep, I constantly had to not only sell against Direct TV, Dish Network, and AT&T U Verse, but also Comcast itself.  I had clients who consistently found better deals through Comcast.com, a local retailer, 3rd party retailers, etc than I was able to offer them.  The only way that I could insure a sale is by hoping to find the customer before they were able to find the lower sale price.

-Your sales depend on many factors. 
 1. The call center has to key your sale in perfectly.
 2. The technician who does the installation for the sale must show up for the job, do their installation up to standard and educate the customer on the products (to which sometimes a tech will blow off a job or work short cuts that will hinder the customer's experience).  
3.  The customer must stay happy with your product or you will be charged back.  Most sales team managers will tell you that a customer must call 1-800-Comcast if he/she has a problem.  The problem is that if you present yourself as the direct liaison (to which you are encouraged by the team leaders  to do to get the sale) between the customer and Comcast, then the customer will be contacting you when there is a problem with their system.  The answer the team leaders tell you to give to the customer is ""Call 1-800-COMCAST"".

-1-800-COMCAST has the worst customer service in the world.  You can be on hold for over 45 minutes and then your call is dropped.  Calling back within the very next second will cause the caller to have to wait possibly just as long again.  

-Weekly meetings were always changed.  Sometimes the meetings were just a few phone call meetings and one meeting as a team at the local Comcast office.  My former team leader would have no regard for time and sometimes extend the meeting from late morning into the mid afternoon.  Then we were made to attend daily meetings at the office for as short as 30 minutes.  This would cause most sales reps to drive 30-60 mins to the office, just to turn around and drive 30-60 mins back to their designated turf areas.  Comcast would only reimburse the rep for $300 (before taxes) of gas monthly.  

-When Comcast offered gift cards to close a sale between a sales rep and the customer, the company rarely ever delivered on giving the customer the gift card.  When I was a rep, we had a chance to lure a customer away from their current television/internet provider  by offering up to $400 in gift cards.  Many clients never received their gift cards which left stress between the client and the sales rep.

-If the sales rep makes a mistake with a customer's order, and the order is completed or closed out, the stress is left between the customer and the sales rep.  The company will not try to repair the incident.

-Team Leaders just want to keep their jobs.  Team Leaders would rather fight for their own jobs instead for their team member's even when they know the decisions of the company's sales management are ethically questionable.

-Turf management (the sales reps respected sales area) for sales reps was directed by upper management based on clients and addresses who have not had Comcast before.  Most of those addresses designated by management were empty lots where there were unfinished subdivisions, or sometimes even Trailer parks that were no longer in existence. You cannot sell to a client or house that isn't there.

-If you decide to leave the company, you will not be permitted to return.  Even if you were a top producing employee with no disciplinary record and have left a two week notice, you will not be permitted to go back to work for Comcast.  The inside word (from management) is that if an employee leaves the Comcast company then he/she will not be permitted to return due to the fact that since the former employee left Comcast in the first place, it shows a sign of non-commitment to Comcast.

8732,1.0,"Former Employee, more than 10 years",Comcast has created the Perfect Prejudice Paradigm,Good benefits package and company is provides entry level training.,"Comcast has created a method for which it can target employees, and eliminates them without the risk of being accused of wrongdoing. This method consists of pining its employees against each other, particularly the front-line employees against their own supervisors. Managers (the supervisors of supervisors) are tasked with holding meetings with front-line employees to solicit feedback on their supervisor's behavior. Of course, these meetings are sanctioned by HR and are held without the presence of supervisors. During the meetings, managers get the employees wound up to say anything, and will use this information to provide corrective action against the employees' supervisors. There is no need for the manager to have his own knowledge of the capacity of the supervisor. In fact, if the manager knows the supervisor well, he may be in a position to understand that the feedback provided by these meetings could be prejudiced, because of the ""gang up"" behavior produced when folks are free to talk without being held responsible for their words. If this personal knowledge were ever an issue (a liability in the process), they would rotate the managers to different work locations, eliminating any history between the manager and his supervisors. This way the managers will depend on the feedback provided by the front-line employees as the only source for corrective actions. This process is used against one supervisor at a time, and its main focus is to push unrealistic goals against all employees. The process is similar to what has been uncovered recently with the scandal related to Wells Fargo. Companies have to stay competitive, but some have found methods to boost their performance beyond the limits. What they do initially is create unrealistic goals for the employees. At first, the employees which are loyal to their own work ethics will be the first to go out the door. They will be dismissed for not meeting the goals. The ones that stay behind and survive realize that they can only do so by cheating. Although the company is squeezing the goals, it does not necessarily increase the level of ethics compliance. That is, it does not pursue ethics compliance as a hot potato, in the same way they pursue the goals watched by investors. The cheats then artificially increase the performance of the company, which is a win for the investors as well as the company, but not necessarily for the employees. Management understands that employees are cheating, although they act like managers are completely out of the picture, and they exhibit this extraordinary level of performance as a well planned, well executed, and natural occurrence. However, if they have a problem with an employee, all they have to do is expose the employee's ethics. I mean, at that level they could literally expose anyone and get rid of them. Unrealistic goals happen in many areas, but two of the critical ones are sales and quality. If the profits look unrealistic, it may very well be that the methods for obtaining these profits are also unrealistic, and primarily unethical. While I was working at the technical side of Comcast, the unrealistic goal was the repeat service call metrics (a quality measure that accounts for repeat service calls, within a 30 day period after a technician visits a customer's home). This metric was just below the 8%, and right now (a year after I left) it may be at 7% or less. Every year it was been dropped to a new and even more unrealistic level, with no sign of stopping, and every day you could increasingly hear the talk about how the cheaters made it happen. The team becomes divided between cheaters and non-cheaters. If a non-cheater tells a cheater; ""let's all be part of a team and tell us your methods, so we can improve our performance,"" the usual response is ""I'm not doing anything different than anyone else."" It's essential for employees to learn and improve their performance through other folks' experiences (although this sharing of information is not really promoted within the company), but there is no real magic bullet that anyone is willing to share. These unrealistic goals create a level of stress that can't be properly managed by the employees, and a great part of it ends up as the wrath generated against supervisors during these feedback meetings. Since the managers depend solely on the feedback of these meetings to make critical decisions about the supervisors, the whole exercise provides a means to target supervisors at will, while at the same time continuing to stage unrealistic levels of performance for their employees. This happens without Comcast, or its upper management, ever becoming responsible for any prejudice done.  However, the prejudice is done with the targeted pinning of employees against themselves, as required by the needs of the business. It’s a business driven with fear that produces a very toxic environment, with false readings and performance, and where employees are stripped of their humanity.",2016-09-19, Technical Operation Supervisor

Has TOO MANY DIFFERENT promotions, leading customers to constantly say, ""Well, I know my neighbor just got this last month.""  ""That's not what I heard/saw advertised."".   Training materials/resources/classes for various positions very poor.  Manuals could be better written and presented.  Internal job aides (CASPER) also not clearly written or presented; a nightmare to the eyes/ hard to navigate; not well edited and not consistantly formated throughout.  Do not work at Comcast unless it is a position off the phones.  I would not even recomment Comcast if you need the health benefits because, YOUR HEALTH CONDITION WILL GET WORSE FROM THE STRESS!

You don't get free service, but it is greatly discounted.","Your job isn't to sell. 
It is to make the sale, then do everything you can to get a tech to actually install the customer. Techs will use every trick in the book to not connect a customer, the tech supervisor will back his techs, but your sales manager will not have your back.
When you actually get a connect, but aren't paid correctly, it is your job to annoy your boss until you give up.
It is also your job to knock doors, and someone in another state decides what addresses you will knock. Be prepared to knock tons of empty houses and addresses that have duplicates in the billing system so you get to look stupid when they already have a triple play. Unfortunately, even if you know they are active, you still have to knock that door.
If you care about your reputation or about customer experience, do not get this job. It will only cause you stress. Trying to fix any problem will anger management, because you aren't getting more sales the more time you spend on an active customers account. If your supervisor loses your paperwork, you are expected to redo it. Management is never at fault for anything. The gas mileage allowance is taxed on your paycheck now, and won't cover half of your gas. If you ask question to find out how to do things correctly, you will only anger your boss. The training is a joke. Comcast will not teach you how to use any electronic system that you will have to use for work. They will constantly change rules without any internal communication. In March 2015, Comcast restructured the commissions and turf management. The majority of what reps were told were changed without letting any reps know. Expect quotas that are improbable to meet. Two home security sales every two weeks, yet the top ranking team had 1.5 home security per rep last fiscal month. Most reps will hardly ever sale a phone or a home security. Even if you do, charge backs will become the bane of your existence. Get 10 sales, maybe 5 get installed. Hopefully 2 won't charge back. Never sell to friends or family or neighbors. Either they will have problems or they will charge back on you. Be prepared to live on $27,000 a year, ruin a vehicle, be micromanaged, constant stress, and never have time with your family. This isn't a sales job. It is a constant dead end fight. Fight for your sales, your connects, your pay, and fight for the customer. Dead end at this job, because there isn't any career path. While fighting for the customer, you will learn that for a communication company, there isn't any communication between departments. Tech ops, direct sales, .com, etc are always at odds.

It lower the average commission by around 1000 or more a month. They also increased sales goals for most months during what they call the busiest months but most saw no increase in sales but rather a decrease and a clear drastic loss of income. Also, management use to give some leeway towards bad periods and take into account your overall sales performance but not anymore. If you fail to perform in just one two week interval you are written up and in that first write up you have to keep your sales on track for 6 periods aka 3 months or you go to stage 2 and if you don't perform in the next 6 periods you go to stage 3 then the next failed period and their showing you the door.

They have virtually impossible sales expectations but still want you to upsell products and services even when customers really don't need or want them.  It's no wonder they have been in the Customer Service Hall of Shame top 5 slots for the most part of the last decade.  It is completely pointless when filling out their internal surveys or participating in the focus groups (they claim to want to know your thoughts and opinions) because they never listen to their low level employees.  If you happen to be a member of management, you are never wrong even when it can be proven that you were wrong.  Non-management employees get blamed for everything and when you provide your evidence of their wrong doing or your innocence, you get labeled as some sort of a domestic terrorist.  Therefore, don't look for any type of praise but definitely expect to be reprimanded.  Also, don't look for any type of assistance from management.

Installation's ""techs"" against Sales Department; for every ten sales made they can only install half of them, due to negligence or plain indifference. Managers in sales are openly afraid to push the Installs department, and on top of that, most of the installations are channeled to an unnecessary contractor company named OCC, that uses Asian immigrants and scary elements that can't speak English and create the most frustrating cases and behavior complaints there are. This contractor is obviously owned by managers working inside Comcast that protect their ""business"" better than their own Comcast jobs. Amazingly nobody in the company denounces this self-inflicted infection and the result is a very low moral stance in the whole Sales ""silent"" Department. The always complex and reducing Commissions Plan is always late or never seen and customer satisfaction is on the floor, funnily, the laughable incompetent managers and ridiculously ignorant and biased Supervisors, never give the sales teams respite at pushing for sales that barely can be turned into accounts. Supervisors approach to motivation is prehistoric and full of insinuated threats and poor cheap rhetoric. Last but never least, Sales competes with itself with different offers and pricing, and a brutal schizoid advertising investment, designed probably by 13 year old nincompoops. Comcast let you ""buy"" its continuously growing lines of business on Internet, Direct Mail, Telemarketing, Retail Boots, (its own) Stores, Direct Sales Reps, external Contractors and TV/Customer Service. So, good luck if you think there's something to do in a Sales position in this futuristic, yet retrograde company. Products, so far, are an enormous line-up of Cable Channels (where you can barely choose two or three to watch), Internet (their best product), Telephone, (nice features and reach), Home Security (that nobody understand how it works and less who can install it properly), Solar (per their own advertising) and probably Taxi Service and Pop Corn Delivery as the trend goes, …. in a few months.",2015-09-02, Anonymous

The pay is below industry standards and if it weren’t for the deep discounts that employees receive for the services that Comcast offers, most employees would not be able to afford them.","‘There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.’ – Mark Twain

Metrics is just another word for statistics and most of the management is hopped up on metrics to the point that they find it difficult to make common sense decisions (ex: Of course customers want to speak with someone in their native language and that speaks it as their primary language). 

It’s easier to manipulate metrics than it is to manage people, so management spends most of their time generating metrics that support that they are doing a good job, even when they are failing. Any time that they spend with their employees is usually spent cracking the whip.

Comcast is known to be the worst company in America for 2015. This is not my opinion, this is according to the American Customer Satisfaction survey and the Consumerist (I wouldn’t have ranked us that low, I truly thought we were a better company). This isn’t just an anomaly for 2015, they frequently rank lowest or second to lowest for telecom, it’s just this year they scored low enough to be considered the worst across all industries. Congratulations, I guess. The company’s reputation was so bad that they had to rebrand its services as Xfinity, but they did nothing to improve the people experience, so the high cost of rebranding bought them nothing. Churn away. Comcast is notorious for treating people poorly. It’s a reputation that they don’t care for, but do nothing to change.
